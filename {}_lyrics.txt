What do you say to the dead?
Will you forgive me for living?
Can't believe the things that they said
Wonderful day for a killing
It's killing me!What do they do with your soul?
Is it just lying there busted?
When did you lose all control?
Is there someone to be trusted with my mind?Oh there's insufficient evidence
Of what just might come after
But sometimes out of nowhere
There's demented sounds of laughterAre we all haunted by the ghost - imagination?
It just can't be, I've seen them there howling at the moon
Is it just me or does somebody else, believe this
Well I'm not alone and I'm not afraid
There's just one way to see after all
After all
After all
After allWhat do you say to the dead?
Is there a place where it's burning?
It says in a book I once read
Yes, there's a chance of returning
Turn to meThe fundamental principles
Say nothing of forever
But those are voices that I hear
Or I'm just not so cleverIt can't be me I know somebody else, believes this
Well I'm not alone, I'm not afraid
Just one way to see after all
After all
Coming after all
After all
After all 
Do you hear the thunder
Raging in the sky?
Premonition of a
Shattered world that's gonna dieIn the Age of Reason
how do we survive?
The protocols of evil
Ravaging so many lives?
So many lives
So many livesMystifying silence
Talking Peace on Earth
We should judge each other
For ourselves not what we're worthSustainable extinction
A fractured human race
A jaded revolution
Disappears without a trace
without a trace
without a trace
Alrigth yeahAlways felt that there'd be trouble
Mass distraction hides the truth
Prozac days and sleepless hours
Seeds of change that don't bear fruitoh yeah,
these time are heavy
And you're all alone
The battle's over
But the war goes onPolitics, religion
Love of money too
It's what the world was built for
But not for me and you, oh yeah 
Super animation, turning on a nation
And they're saying all moving parts stand still
Since he was elected, adrenalin injected
Hear him saying all moving parts should kill
Just like the hero he's got them all on the run
Yes he's won, yeahSince he passed the motion, they're building in the ocean
And he's saying all men should be free
What a combination, peace and radiation
And he's saying free men should fight for me
Just like his momma, he seems to get his pleasure from pain,
And the rain, ain't that strange?
Very strange, yeahI like choking toys
You've got to see me before you meet the boys
Teacher's burnt the school
He's had enough of sticking to the rules, alrightPeople stop and see
He's got to be more decadent than me
Just to pass the time
He gets his kicks from licking off the wine 
Can you see me, are you near me?
Can you hear me crying out for life?
Can you tell me, where's the glory?
Ride the days and sail the nights
When it's over you'll find the answer
Running in the whispering rain
Anno Mundi? can you wonder!
Truth of thunder, life or blameDo you see a vision of a perfect place?
Does it make you laugh, put a smile on your face?
Do you need a mirror, do you see it well?
Does the hand of God still toll the bell?
There are people laughing
They're all laughing on you
If only they could see what you're saying is true
Still generals fighting, making war on the world
Don't they know, don't they know?
No, no, no[Chorus]
The wind in the night blows cold
Your eyes are burning
As the sands of our time grow old
Anno MundiDo you follow the path that so many tread?
Are you among the blind so easily lead?
Do you join the war, do you fight for the cause?
Depend on another to fight it alone[Chorus]Can you see me now, can you hear me now?
Can you tell me, where's the glory?
Ride the days and sail the nights
When it's over, you'll find the answer
Runnin' in the rainThere's a hope that's growing and a vision too
All those angry hearts now reach out for you
Do you look to the dawn, see a new day begun?
No longer the fool, the vision is done 
Can you see me, are you near me?
Can you hear me crying out for life?
Can you tell me, where's the glory?
Ride the days and sail the nights
When it's over you'll find the answer
Running in the whispering rain
Anno Mundi? can you wonder!
Truth of thunder, life or blameDo you see a vision of a perfect place?
Does it make you laugh, put a smile on your face?
Do you need a mirror, do you see it well?
Does the hand of God still toll the bell?
There are people laughing
They're all laughing on you
If only they could see what you're saying is true
Still generals fighting, making war on the world
Don't they know, don't they know?
No, no, no[Chorus]
The wind in the night blows cold
Your eyes are burning
As the sands of our time grow old
Anno MundiDo you follow the path that so many tread?
Are you among the blind so easily lead?
Do you join the war, do you fight for the cause?
Depend on another to fight it alone[Chorus]Can you see me now, can you hear me now?
Can you tell me, where's the glory?
Ride the days and sail the nights
When it's over, you'll find the answer
Runnin' in the rainThere's a hope that's growing and a vision too
All those angry hearts now reach out for you
Do you look to the dawn, see a new day begun?
No longer the fool, the vision is done 
Vengence cupped within the flower
Deadly petals with strange power
Faces shine a deadly smile
Look upon you at your trialChill that numbs from head to toe
Icy sun with frosty glow
Words that go read to your sorrow
Words that go read no tomorrowFeel your spirit rise with the breeze
See your body falling to it's knees
Sleeping wall of remorse
Turns your body to a corpse
Turns your body to a corpse
Turns your body to a corpse
Sleeping wall of remorse
Turns your body to a corpseNow from darkness there springs light
Wall of sleep is cool and bright
Wall of sleep is lying broken
Sun shines in you have awoken 
The intro to this song has a seperate title, it's called Wasp
Precious cups within the flower
deadly petals with strange power
faces shine a deadly smile
back up on you at your trialChill and numbs from head to toe
icy sun with frosty glow
Why'd you go reaching your sorrow?
why'd you go read no tomorrowFeel your spirit rise with the priest
feel your body falling to its knees
Take your walk of remorse
take your body to a corpse
take your body to a corpse
take your body to a corpse
if you want all remorse
take your body to a corpseNow from darkness, there springs light
Wall of Sleep is cold and bright
Wall of Sleep is lying broken
Sun shines in, you are awoken 
What is this that stands before me?
Figure in black which points at me
Turn around quick, and start to run
Find out I'm the chosen one
Oh noBig black shape with eyes of fire
Telling people their desire
Satan's sitting there, he's smiling
Watches those flames get higher and higher
Oh no, no, please god help me!Is it the end, my friend?
Satan's coming 'round the bend
People running 'cause they're scared
The people better go and beware
No, no, please, no 
Blow on a jug
Everybody come on - blow on a jug
Be like me and blow on a jug
I want you to blow on a jug
Everybody begin - blow on a jug 
(instrumental) 
In this last and final hour, you can't hide
There's nowhere now that you can run
All eyes are on you, like a lost Eternal Light
Princes and Kings, Demons with wings
Summon your fears from hellIt's the call of the wild Calling youIn this last macabre hour, witches cry
And turn to dust before the moon
Many spirits are lost forever, but one survives
To call the tune of luciferIt's the call of the wild Calling youHero, only in the grave are there no dreams
Hero, don't believe in fate, it ain't what it seemsAll you gotta do now is stay free
You're the one they turn to when hell screamsFear of the devil has no place among the brave
Faced with pain, there's a battle to be won
All eyes are on you, like a lost Eternal Light
Princes and Kings, Demons with wings
Summon your fears from hellIt's the call of the wild Calling youHero, only in the grave are there no dreams
Hero, don't believe in fate, it ain't what it seemsHero, only in the grave are there no dreams
Hero, don't believe in fate, it ain't what it seemsHero, you got the fear of the devil burning your soul
Hero, It's the call of the wild
Hero, Tearing your soul 
How many tears must we cry before learning,
Things that we have they're for real and we're losing,
Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away.Why do you believe that we've got something coming,
You took it all, left me standing here with nothing,
Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away,
Too far away.In your world you must be dreaming, if you think you can survive,
Taking all and giving nothing that's a crime.
What makes you something special, what about me, I'm here too,
You don't care what I'm feeling and that's the truth.
Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away.All I need is understanding and the right to survive,
Only you could see the warnings, and pass them by.
What makes you something special, what about me, I'm here too,
You don't care what I'm feeling and that's the truth.
Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away.
Too far away.
Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away. 
[Instrumental] 
A childhood innocence was drowned in your tears
The demons that you fought are feeding your fears
The poisoned secrets of your life stand revealed
The truth destroys you, its no longer concealedDear father forsaken, you knew what you were doing
In silence your violence has left my life in ruin
Yeah, in ruin, yeahYou preyed upon my flesh then prayed for my soul
Belief betrayed by lust, the faith that you stole
Indoctrination by a twisted desire
The catechism of an evil messiahDear father forgive me, I know just what I'm doing
In silence this violence will leave your life in ruin
Yeah, in ruin, yeahPreacher of theocracy hiding your hypocrisy
Under false sanctity, holy phoney empathy
You have taken my life
Now it's your turn to dieCan you sleep at night? when you close your eyes
Do you think of all the pain from your lies?
Or do you deny you're responsible
For the victims of the sins you devised?What you gonna tell them when they ask you? well then
Is your conscience pure in your heart?
There is no exemption when you seek redemption
For all the lives that you've torn apartYour molestations of the cross you defiled
A man once holy now despised and reviled
You took possession while confessing my sins
And now you have to face whatever death brings, yeahDear father forsaken, you knew what you were doing
In silence your violence has left my life in ruin, yeah
In ruin, yeah, yeah, yeah
In ruin yeah 
Silence is mocking the dawn of a new day
Devil and daughter are both on their way
The evil of her nature collects in her eyes
With him theres no fear of the dawn bringing lightBaptized with fire, too wild to be tamed
Shes hot, evil and ready to take any man
Let no one put asunder, the power of the pain
He is the master of hell, riding againDevil and daughter
Pleasure and pain
Devil and daughter
Is this the end?A thousand times over, youll hear on the wind
In the name of hell, these sinners never sinned
But Satan never listens to the words that they send
Drenching the soul with blood, when will it endDevil and daughter
Hes got the power, shes got the pain
Devil and daughter
Shell break any woman and take any manDevil and daughter
Hand in hand with the reaper 
One fine day in Hell
The master told a story
Someone lied so well
He sent him back to GloryThere are whispers between the screams
That this deed can be done
Even sinners must dream
And I can be the one to make the Devil cryI can win this game
If all things come together
I know this sounds quite strange
I won't be smart, just cleverIt's the law on the other side
Just the kill lets you run
And how many have tried?
I know I'll be the one to make the Devil cryAt last my time has come
I must not give him pleasure
I can be the one
One chance or burn foreverSo I told him about my pain
And the life I've been through
He just smiled and the laughter came
Then I told him that I love you, and the Devil criedTears from his eyes
Eyes of fire
And the devil cried 
Let's try getting to the sky
Hang on or you're going to die
Sour life can turn sweet
It's laying at your feet
Sweet child with an innocent smile
Watched closely all the while
Don't be fooled when he cries
Keep looking at the eyesGood life is contradiction
Because of the crucifixion
If you're ready and have the need
I will take your soul and plant my seedYou just gotta listen to the night at the ending of the day
You just gotta listen to the night as safety slips away
Moving out of sight are the things you need to see to feel
And as they slip away becoming so unreal unreal
You just gotta listen to the night as you're going up stairs
You just gotta listen to the night and don't forget to say your prayers
And as you lose control to the eyes in dark disguise
And icy fingers fan electric liesWe're disturbing the priest
Won't you please come to our feast
Do we mind disturbing the priest
Not at all not at all not in the least 
Instrumental 
(instrumental) 
Hello, can you hear me? I might not be alone
Don't see anyone near me but I just won't go home again
Let's meet in the morning, I just can't speak tonight
This is more than a warning, be silent 'till it's lightAnd then you know I'll be there, waiting for someone to believe me
Remembering it all makes my flesh start to crawl
I've seen an ear in the wallThis time, it could prove it but you've heard this all before
Cry wolf and you're moving to a special kind of danger zone
I need a witness, somebody just like you
So bring an exorcist, a wizard and the holy ghostYou know I'll be there, waiting for someone to believe me
Remembering it all makes my flesh creep and crawl
I've seen an ear in the wallOne more reason, one more time
Someone's searching through my mind
Now where am I supposed to go
It's not who you are, it's who you know
What's it gonna be?I knew you would answer, I'm the curiosity
You could miss a chance because the fool might see reality
There it is, in the corner, you must be going blind
What's wrong? Were you born before your God invented eyes?It's got to be there, grinding away at my secrets
It's growing so dark and you can't see it all
I'll turn on some lights so you're sure not to fall
It's next to the eye in the wall 
Instrumental 
Is this the end of the beginning?
Or the beginning of the end?
Losing control or are you winning?
Is your life real or just pretend?Reanimation of the sequence
Rewinds the future to the past
To find the source of the solution
The system has to be repairedRelease your mind
Fast forward to the secrets of your soul
Your life's on overload
Is this your fate?Will you decide what makes you an entity
That's your identity
Well if you don't know
Which way to goYou might be lost and confused
A second chance no time to loseReanimation of your cyber sonic soul
Transforming time and space beyond control
Rise up and resist to be the master of your fate
Don't look back before today- tomorrow is too lateYou don't want to be a robot ghost
Occupied inside a human host
Analyzed and cloned relentlessly
Synthesized until they set you freeAlright-okay, alright
Till they set you free
Alright-okay
Till they set you freeI don't want to see you, yeah
I don't want to see you, yeah 
I've seen a look of evil in your eyes
You've been filling me all full of lies
Sorrow will not change your shameful deeds
Do well best, someone else has better seenEvil woman, don't you play your games with me
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me

The outro to this song has it's own title, Jack the Stripper
Goin' home, late last night
suddenly I got a fright
Yeah I looked throught the window and surprised what I saw
Fairy boots were dancin' with a dwarf, all right now!Fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
yeah I saw it, I saw it, I tell you no lies
Yeah Fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
I saw it, I saw it with my own two eyes, well all right now!So I went to the doctor, see what he could give me
he said "Son, son, you've gone too far.
'cause smokin' and trippin' is all that you do."
