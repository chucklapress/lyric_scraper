What do you say to the dead?
Will you forgive me for living?
Can't believe the things that they said
Wonderful day for a killing
It's killing me!What do they do with your soul?
Is it just lying there busted?
When did you lose all control?
Is there someone to be trusted with my mind?Oh there's insufficient evidence
Of what just might come after
But sometimes out of nowhere
There's demented sounds of laughterAre we all haunted by the ghost - imagination?
It just can't be, I've seen them there howling at the moon
Is it just me or does somebody else, believe this
Well I'm not alone and I'm not afraid
There's just one way to see after all
After all
After all
After allWhat do you say to the dead?
Is there a place where it's burning?
It says in a book I once read
Yes, there's a chance of returning
Turn to meThe fundamental principles
Say nothing of forever
But those are voices that I hear
Or I'm just not so cleverIt can't be me I know somebody else, believes this
Well I'm not alone, I'm not afraid
Just one way to see after all
After all
Coming after all
After all
After all 
Do you hear the thunder
Raging in the sky?
Premonition of a
Shattered world that's gonna dieIn the Age of Reason
how do we survive?
The protocols of evil
Ravaging so many lives?
So many lives
So many livesMystifying silence
Talking Peace on Earth
We should judge each other
For ourselves not what we're worthSustainable extinction
A fractured human race
A jaded revolution
Disappears without a trace
without a trace
without a trace
Alrigth yeahAlways felt that there'd be trouble
Mass distraction hides the truth
Prozac days and sleepless hours
Seeds of change that don't bear fruitoh yeah,
these time are heavy
And you're all alone
The battle's over
But the war goes onPolitics, religion
Love of money too
It's what the world was built for
But not for me and you, oh yeah 
Super animation, turning on a nation
And they're saying all moving parts stand still
Since he was elected, adrenalin injected
Hear him saying all moving parts should kill
Just like the hero he's got them all on the run
Yes he's won, yeahSince he passed the motion, they're building in the ocean
And he's saying all men should be free
What a combination, peace and radiation
And he's saying free men should fight for me
Just like his momma, he seems to get his pleasure from pain,
And the rain, ain't that strange?
Very strange, yeahI like choking toys
You've got to see me before you meet the boys
Teacher's burnt the school
He's had enough of sticking to the rules, alrightPeople stop and see
He's got to be more decadent than me
Just to pass the time
He gets his kicks from licking off the wine 
Can you see me, are you near me?
Can you hear me crying out for life?
Can you tell me, where's the glory?
Ride the days and sail the nights
When it's over you'll find the answer
Running in the whispering rain
Anno Mundi? can you wonder!
Truth of thunder, life or blameDo you see a vision of a perfect place?
Does it make you laugh, put a smile on your face?
Do you need a mirror, do you see it well?
Does the hand of God still toll the bell?
There are people laughing
They're all laughing on you
If only they could see what you're saying is true
Still generals fighting, making war on the world
Don't they know, don't they know?
No, no, no[Chorus]
The wind in the night blows cold
Your eyes are burning
As the sands of our time grow old
Anno MundiDo you follow the path that so many tread?
Are you among the blind so easily lead?
Do you join the war, do you fight for the cause?
Depend on another to fight it alone[Chorus]Can you see me now, can you hear me now?
Can you tell me, where's the glory?
Ride the days and sail the nights
When it's over, you'll find the answer
Runnin' in the rainThere's a hope that's growing and a vision too
All those angry hearts now reach out for you
Do you look to the dawn, see a new day begun?
No longer the fool, the vision is done 
Can you see me, are you near me?
Can you hear me crying out for life?
Can you tell me, where's the glory?
Ride the days and sail the nights
When it's over you'll find the answer
Running in the whispering rain
Anno Mundi? can you wonder!
Truth of thunder, life or blameDo you see a vision of a perfect place?
Does it make you laugh, put a smile on your face?
Do you need a mirror, do you see it well?
Does the hand of God still toll the bell?
There are people laughing
They're all laughing on you
If only they could see what you're saying is true
Still generals fighting, making war on the world
Don't they know, don't they know?
No, no, no[Chorus]
The wind in the night blows cold
Your eyes are burning
As the sands of our time grow old
Anno MundiDo you follow the path that so many tread?
Are you among the blind so easily lead?
Do you join the war, do you fight for the cause?
Depend on another to fight it alone[Chorus]Can you see me now, can you hear me now?
Can you tell me, where's the glory?
Ride the days and sail the nights
When it's over, you'll find the answer
Runnin' in the rainThere's a hope that's growing and a vision too
All those angry hearts now reach out for you
Do you look to the dawn, see a new day begun?
No longer the fool, the vision is done 
Vengence cupped within the flower
Deadly petals with strange power
Faces shine a deadly smile
Look upon you at your trialChill that numbs from head to toe
Icy sun with frosty glow
Words that go read to your sorrow
Words that go read no tomorrowFeel your spirit rise with the breeze
See your body falling to it's knees
Sleeping wall of remorse
Turns your body to a corpse
Turns your body to a corpse
Turns your body to a corpse
Sleeping wall of remorse
Turns your body to a corpseNow from darkness there springs light
Wall of sleep is cool and bright
Wall of sleep is lying broken
Sun shines in you have awoken 
The intro to this song has a seperate title, it's called Wasp
Precious cups within the flower
deadly petals with strange power
faces shine a deadly smile
back up on you at your trialChill and numbs from head to toe
icy sun with frosty glow
Why'd you go reaching your sorrow?
why'd you go read no tomorrowFeel your spirit rise with the priest
feel your body falling to its knees
Take your walk of remorse
take your body to a corpse
take your body to a corpse
take your body to a corpse
if you want all remorse
take your body to a corpseNow from darkness, there springs light
Wall of Sleep is cold and bright
Wall of Sleep is lying broken
Sun shines in, you are awoken 
What is this that stands before me?
Figure in black which points at me
Turn around quick, and start to run
Find out I'm the chosen one
Oh noBig black shape with eyes of fire
Telling people their desire
Satan's sitting there, he's smiling
Watches those flames get higher and higher
Oh no, no, please god help me!Is it the end, my friend?
Satan's coming 'round the bend
People running 'cause they're scared
The people better go and beware
No, no, please, no 
Blow on a jug
Everybody come on - blow on a jug
Be like me and blow on a jug
I want you to blow on a jug
Everybody begin - blow on a jug 
(instrumental) 
In this last and final hour, you can't hide
There's nowhere now that you can run
All eyes are on you, like a lost Eternal Light
Princes and Kings, Demons with wings
Summon your fears from hellIt's the call of the wild Calling youIn this last macabre hour, witches cry
And turn to dust before the moon
Many spirits are lost forever, but one survives
To call the tune of luciferIt's the call of the wild Calling youHero, only in the grave are there no dreams
Hero, don't believe in fate, it ain't what it seemsAll you gotta do now is stay free
You're the one they turn to when hell screamsFear of the devil has no place among the brave
Faced with pain, there's a battle to be won
All eyes are on you, like a lost Eternal Light
Princes and Kings, Demons with wings
Summon your fears from hellIt's the call of the wild Calling youHero, only in the grave are there no dreams
Hero, don't believe in fate, it ain't what it seemsHero, only in the grave are there no dreams
Hero, don't believe in fate, it ain't what it seemsHero, you got the fear of the devil burning your soul
Hero, It's the call of the wild
Hero, Tearing your soul 
How many tears must we cry before learning,
Things that we have they're for real and we're losing,
Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away.Why do you believe that we've got something coming,
You took it all, left me standing here with nothing,
Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away,
Too far away.In your world you must be dreaming, if you think you can survive,
Taking all and giving nothing that's a crime.
What makes you something special, what about me, I'm here too,
You don't care what I'm feeling and that's the truth.
Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away.All I need is understanding and the right to survive,
Only you could see the warnings, and pass them by.
What makes you something special, what about me, I'm here too,
You don't care what I'm feeling and that's the truth.
Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away.
Too far away.
Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away. 
[Instrumental] 
A childhood innocence was drowned in your tears
The demons that you fought are feeding your fears
The poisoned secrets of your life stand revealed
The truth destroys you, its no longer concealedDear father forsaken, you knew what you were doing
In silence your violence has left my life in ruin
Yeah, in ruin, yeahYou preyed upon my flesh then prayed for my soul
Belief betrayed by lust, the faith that you stole
Indoctrination by a twisted desire
The catechism of an evil messiahDear father forgive me, I know just what I'm doing
In silence this violence will leave your life in ruin
Yeah, in ruin, yeahPreacher of theocracy hiding your hypocrisy
Under false sanctity, holy phoney empathy
You have taken my life
Now it's your turn to dieCan you sleep at night? when you close your eyes
Do you think of all the pain from your lies?
Or do you deny you're responsible
For the victims of the sins you devised?What you gonna tell them when they ask you? well then
Is your conscience pure in your heart?
There is no exemption when you seek redemption
For all the lives that you've torn apartYour molestations of the cross you defiled
A man once holy now despised and reviled
You took possession while confessing my sins
And now you have to face whatever death brings, yeahDear father forsaken, you knew what you were doing
In silence your violence has left my life in ruin, yeah
In ruin, yeah, yeah, yeah
In ruin yeah 
Silence is mocking the dawn of a new day
Devil and daughter are both on their way
The evil of her nature collects in her eyes
With him theres no fear of the dawn bringing lightBaptized with fire, too wild to be tamed
Shes hot, evil and ready to take any man
Let no one put asunder, the power of the pain
He is the master of hell, riding againDevil and daughter
Pleasure and pain
Devil and daughter
Is this the end?A thousand times over, youll hear on the wind
In the name of hell, these sinners never sinned
But Satan never listens to the words that they send
Drenching the soul with blood, when will it endDevil and daughter
Hes got the power, shes got the pain
Devil and daughter
Shell break any woman and take any manDevil and daughter
Hand in hand with the reaper 
One fine day in Hell
The master told a story
Someone lied so well
He sent him back to GloryThere are whispers between the screams
That this deed can be done
Even sinners must dream
And I can be the one to make the Devil cryI can win this game
If all things come together
I know this sounds quite strange
I won't be smart, just cleverIt's the law on the other side
Just the kill lets you run
And how many have tried?
I know I'll be the one to make the Devil cryAt last my time has come
I must not give him pleasure
I can be the one
One chance or burn foreverSo I told him about my pain
And the life I've been through
He just smiled and the laughter came
Then I told him that I love you, and the Devil criedTears from his eyes
Eyes of fire
And the devil cried 
Let's try getting to the sky
Hang on or you're going to die
Sour life can turn sweet
It's laying at your feet
Sweet child with an innocent smile
Watched closely all the while
Don't be fooled when he cries
Keep looking at the eyesGood life is contradiction
Because of the crucifixion
If you're ready and have the need
I will take your soul and plant my seedYou just gotta listen to the night at the ending of the day
You just gotta listen to the night as safety slips away
Moving out of sight are the things you need to see to feel
And as they slip away becoming so unreal unreal
You just gotta listen to the night as you're going up stairs
You just gotta listen to the night and don't forget to say your prayers
And as you lose control to the eyes in dark disguise
And icy fingers fan electric liesWe're disturbing the priest
Won't you please come to our feast
Do we mind disturbing the priest
Not at all not at all not in the least 
Instrumental 
(instrumental) 
Hello, can you hear me? I might not be alone
Don't see anyone near me but I just won't go home again
Let's meet in the morning, I just can't speak tonight
This is more than a warning, be silent 'till it's lightAnd then you know I'll be there, waiting for someone to believe me
Remembering it all makes my flesh start to crawl
I've seen an ear in the wallThis time, it could prove it but you've heard this all before
Cry wolf and you're moving to a special kind of danger zone
I need a witness, somebody just like you
So bring an exorcist, a wizard and the holy ghostYou know I'll be there, waiting for someone to believe me
Remembering it all makes my flesh creep and crawl
I've seen an ear in the wallOne more reason, one more time
Someone's searching through my mind
Now where am I supposed to go
It's not who you are, it's who you know
What's it gonna be?I knew you would answer, I'm the curiosity
You could miss a chance because the fool might see reality
There it is, in the corner, you must be going blind
What's wrong? Were you born before your God invented eyes?It's got to be there, grinding away at my secrets
It's growing so dark and you can't see it all
I'll turn on some lights so you're sure not to fall
It's next to the eye in the wall 
Instrumental 
I've seen a look of evil in your eyes
You've been filling me all full of lies
Sorrow will not change your shameful deeds
Do well best, someone else has better seenEvil woman, don't you play your games with me
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me

The outro to this song has it's own title, Jack the Stripper
Goin' home, late last night
suddenly I got a fright
Yeah I looked throught the window and surprised what I saw
Fairy boots were dancin' with a dwarf, all right now!Fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
yeah I saw it, I saw it, I tell you no lies
Yeah Fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
I saw it, I saw it with my own two eyes, well all right now!So I went to the doctor, see what he could give me
he said "Son, son, you've gone too far.
'cause smokin' and trippin' is all that you do." 
Instrumental 
Goin' home late last night,
Suddenly I got a fright
Yeah, I looked through a window and surprise what I saw
Fairy boots are dancin' with a dwarf
All right nowYeah fairies wear boots, and you gotta believe me
Yeah, I saw it, I saw it I tell you no lies
Yeah Fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
I saw it I saw it with my own two eyes
Woah right nowYeah fairies wear boots, and you gotta believe me
Yeah, I saw it, I saw it I tell you no lies
Yeah fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
I saw it I saw it with my own two eyes
Woah right nowSo I went to the doctor, see what he could give me
He said, son, son you've gone too far,
'Cause smokin' an trippin' is all that you do, yeah 
The highway's screamin', callin' out your name
'Cause every road that you travel on
There's a price to pay
A thousands eyes are starin'
But the blind still lead the blind[Chorus]
Where will you turn if it all goes wrong and you're on the run
Jerusalem?You say you walked through the valley
You say you've seen the signs
Echoes call you from a distant age
Or is it in your mind?Then a thousands souls rise from the sea
Holding up the sun
And an angel cries beware your lies'
It could be the end of it all[Chorus]Everybody knows your name, every road leads to anger
Will it always be the same, is there reason to return?[Chorus]When an angel cries - Jerusalem
Better watch your lies - Jerusalem
When an angel cries - Jerusalem 
There's something wrong, there's a chill in the air
And the blood in my vein's running colder.
The Eastern sky is beginning to silver
And the words that you speak start to falter.
The seal is broken, the oath has been crossed,
In the house of the dead there's a taker.
Some say that this is the ultimate sin
When the spirit world turns to the alter.There's been a kill in the spirit world
There's been a kill in the spirit worldBehold the dead, clutching at fading hands, out of reach forever
"In glory die" calls the voice from the void
You assasin has cursed every spectre
The seal is broken, the oath has been crossed,
And the house of the dead seeks the master
Stretching every muscle, I wait for the end
And the kiss on the wind whispers murder, (murder)There's been a kill in the spirit world
There's been a kill in the spirit world
There's been a kill in the spirit worldWhen heaven is closer, it's pleasure and pain
Blood kill in the spirit world ahDid ya see another in black
Is the blood in your veins running colder?
If ya did, then there's no turing back
As the spirit world turns to the alter.
The seal is broken, the oath has been crossed,
And the house of the dead seeks the master
Stretching every muscle, I wait for the end
And a kiss on the wind whispers murderThere's been a kill in the spirit world
There's been a kill in the spirit worldOh here it comes, no no no-oh oh
Your seal is broken, the Eastern sky is beginning to silver, oh oh oh.
There's something wrong, there's a chill in the air, ah.
You feel the evil, I feel the evil.
Oh somebody whispers murder.A kiss on the wind whispers murder 
Instrumental 
Just before you die
They say you see your life go flashing by
Cold dark endless nights
To burn in hell or bathe in ever lightWell I don't wanna live forever
But I don't want to die
I may be dreaming or whatever
I live inside a lieDays pass by too soon
Waiting for the rising of the moon
No escape from here
Facing death but is your conscious clear?I may be dreaming or whatever
Watching my life go by
And I don't wanna live forever
But I don't wanna dieWell I don't wanna live forever
But I don't want to die
I may be dreaming or whatever
I live inside a lieDon't want to life forever
But I don't want to die
Don't want to life forever
But I don't want to die 
All your life you've been slipping and sliding
Trying to find a way
Sun won't shine but now it's your time to pay
There's no turning back as you look
The hangman in the eyeNow hell's just your death awayIt's too late to say you care
When there's evil in your stare
You say you're not to blame
In your head voices mocking every prayerRemember the face you saw
That once was you
Spirit high there's no way that
You could lose
Give him rope they said
As you look the hangman in the eye
Now around your neck you feel
The nooseIn your head voices mocking every prayer
Now you're lost foreverI'm burning with fire it's time to
Leave or get out
I'm burning in fire I can't take
No more so get out
I'm burning with fire the wheels of
Steel will grind you
Burning in fire this time
You're lost forever
Lost forever!There's an evil in your stare
Lost forever!
And hell's just a breath away
You're lost forever
And there's no way out you burn
With fire it's time to get out
Get out, get out
And there's no way out
Lost forever 
revolution in their minds the children start to march, against the world in which they have and all the hate thats in their hearts, tired of being pushed around and told just what to do,fight the world until theve won and love comes flowing through ,yeah

The world today is such a wicked thing
Fighting going on between the human race
People give good wishes to all their friends
While people just across the sea are counting the deadA politician's job they say is very high
For he has to choose who's got to go and die
They can put a man on the moon quite easy
while people here on earth are dying of old diseasesI don't know whether it is worth all
Wondering how a lie got on my mind
Everybodies running round in circles
Run around everyday as if they're blindA politician's job they say is very high
For he has to choose who's got to go and die
They can put a man on the moon quite easy
while people here on earth are dying of old diseasesSometimes I'm happy
Sometimes I'm sad
I lost my woman
I feel so bad
She was my first love
I needed her
It's hard to bear
I'm on my own
own, own, ownNow I will sit here
Everyday
I love the woman
In every way
She was my first one
It felt so good
I don't know what to say
I just feel cold
cold, cold, coldI want to reach out and touch the sky
I want to touch the sun
But I dont need to fly
Im gonna climb up every mountain of the moon
And find a distant man a-waving his spoonIve crossed the ocean, turned every bend
I found the crossing near a golden rainbows end
Ive been through magic and through lifes reality
Ive lived a thousand years and it never bothered meGot no religion, dont need no friends
Got all I want and I dont need to pretend
Dont try to reach me, cause Id tear up your mind
Ive seen the future and Ive left it behindA woman goes to work every day after day
She just goes to work just to earn her pay
Child sitting crying by a life that's harder
he doesn't even know who is his father 
Mr. Crowley, what went down in your head
(Oh) Mr. Crowley, did you talk to the dead
Your lifestyle to me seems so tragic
With the thrill of it all
You fooled all the people with magic
(Yeah)You waited on Satan's callMr. Charming, did you think you were pure
Mr. Alarming, in nocturnal rapport
Uncovering things that were sacred, manifest on this earth
(Oh)Conceived in the eye of a secret
Yeah, they scattered the afterbirthSoloMr. Crowley, won't you ride my white horse?
Mr. Crowley, it's symbolic of course
Approaching a time that is classic
I hear that maidens call
Approaching a time that is drastic
Standing with their backs to the wall(Solo)Was it polemically sent?
I wanna know what you meant
I wanna know
I wanna know what you meant, yeah! 
N.i.b./basically
Black Sabbath

Nightwing has stirred, and taken to flight
The silence is over, he's shattered the night
No other hunter has the power or the grace
He is the master of this placeTell every creature of the night
The kill is around the bend
So listen my friend
Nightwing flies againThey say he comes for those whose souls are weak
And call his name upon the wind
The night is cold and thick with mystery
Oh I can feel his beating wingsTell every creature of the night
The kill is around the bend
Nightwing flies againTell every creature of the night
The kill is around the bend
Nightwing flies againNightwing has stirred, and taken to flight
The silence is over, he's shattered the night
Life ain't for giving and forgiving ain't free
No soul will rest while the hunted run freeSo tell every creature of the night
The kill is around the bend
Listen my friend
Nightwing flies again 
As you walk alone the night surrounds you like a shroud
The dreams you had were once of love and being proud
Misty horizons block your vision of the world
But the raven's eyes will show you all you need to knowThe land you loved is now so barren and so cold
The name of God rings out so high in your soul
This time is masters will lead us by the sword
And should we fait them all prevails in Odin's court 
Instrumental 
Sometimes I feel like I'm dying at dawn
And sometimes I'm warm as fire
But lately I feel like I'm just gonna rain
And it goes over, and over, and over again, yeahToo many flames, with too much to burn
And life's only made of paper
Oh, how I need to be free of this pain
But it goes over, and over, and over, and over againYeah, sometimes I cry for the lost and alone
And for their dreams that will all be ashes
But lately I feel like I'm just gonna rain
And it goes over, and over, and over, and over again(Over)
(Over) 
I wish somebody would empty my head
I am so sorry for the things that I've said
This hopeless feeling that's living inside
I'm just a lonely soul who's trying to find
Some peace of mindI ain't no hero who's gonna save you
I just say "hi" as I'm passing right through
I ain't that crazy, I'm only here for the ride
So please forgive me while I'm trying to find
Some peace of mindRead in between the lines
Truth that is neither black nor white
Black nor white
Just give me something real
Broken man still searching for the light
In the nightCaught In the middle as the front line falls
It looks like I don't stand a chance
If only I could turn my life around
Or is this just the circumstance 
Instrumental 
[instrumental] 
There's a vision in the sands
Rising from the ancient past
Crying let my spirit go
Lead my burning soul to restHear the sound of distant ages
It's the call of the seventh starThere's no shelter from the heat
There's no mercy from this land
Hear a thousand chanting souls
Waiting judgment from god's handHear the sound of distant ages
It's the call of the seventh star
Hear the sound of fallen angels
It's the call of the seventh starThe pyramids will fall
Turn to dust before the sun
And the star will rise again
Until destiny is doneHear the sound of distant ages
It's the call of the seventh star
Hear the sound of fallen angels
It's the call of the seventh star 
Oh, it's night again
And the dark just killed the sun
If the light must end
You've got time to run awayThere's a door to dreams
And it always lets you in
But with a silent scream
All the nightmares must beginStill you chase what you can't see
Like death and pain and sin
And the shadow of the wind
The shadow of the windYou'll remember me
I could make you disappear
Be where you want to be
Just as long as it's not hereWell, I'm back and stronger
And the first one's always free
And it lasts much longer
You can bet your sanity'Never more', the victim cries
As I slip beneath the skin
Like the shadow of the wind
The shadow of the windIf words had names like red and green
And two for sympathy
Black and white and in between
Then you'd be miseryEvery day is an inquisition
Who are you? What are you? Why?
I'm alive, I belong, I'll be back
It's a half truth, still a whole lieIn the garden of good and evil
You'll know but you know
The spider only spins
The shadow of the wind
The shadow of the wind 
 
Red sun rising in the sky
Sleeping village, cockerels cry
Soft breeze blowing in the trees
Peace of mind, feel at ease 
I. A Bit of Finger(Instrumental)II. Sleeping VillageRed sun rising in the sky
Sleeping village, cockerels cry
Soft breeze blowing in the trees
Peace of mind, feel at easeIII. WarningNow the first day that I met ya
I was looking in the sky
When the sun turned all a blur
And the thunderclouds rolled by
The sea began to shiver
And the wind began to moan
It must've been a sign for me
To leave you well alone
I was born without you, baby
But my feelings were a little bit too strong
You never said you love me
And I don't believe you can
'Cause I saw you in a dream
And you were with another man
You looked so cool and casual
And I tried to look the same
But now I've got to know ya
Tell me who am I to blame?
I was born without you, baby
But my feelings were a little bit too strong
Now the whole wide world is movin'
'Cause there's iron in my heart
I just can't keep from cryin'
'Cause you say we've got to part
Sorrow grips my voice as I stand here all alone
And watch you slowly take away
A love I've never known
I was born without you, baby
But my feelings were a little bit too strong
Just a little bit too strong 
[instrumental] 
[Instrumental] 
instrumental 
The horizon breaks, where a figure stands
Close your eyes and pray it's a vision of God's command[Chorus]
He's evil and mysterious, people fear his name
He's not here for deliverance, no
He's the LawmakerHe newer speaks, but his task we're told
To seek out souls of the sinners, he'll trade for gold[Chorus]Silver mountains won't save you from hell
The prince of darkness inside you will dwell
Oh your weakness your past
The Lawmaker comes[Chorus]He's the Lawmaker 
Well I don't want no demon to tell me what it's all about
No black magician telling me to get my soul out
Don't believe in violence, I don't even believe in peace
I've opened the door and my mind has been releasedWell I don't want no preacher telling me about the god in the sky
No I don't want no one to tell me where I'm gonna go when I die
I want to live my life with no people telling me what to do
I just believe in myself, 'cause no one else is trueEvery day just comes and goes
Life is one big overdose
People try to ruin me
And I can't seem to eliminate themPeople riding their real pace
Keep on running their rat race
Behind each flower grows a weed
In their world of make-believe 
Well I don't want no demon to tell me what it's all about
No black magician telling me to get my soul out
Don't believe in violence, I don't even believe in peace
I've opened the door and my mind has been released

Well I don't want no preacher telling me about the god in the sky
No I don't want no one to tell me where I'm gonna go when I die
I want to live my life with no people telling me what to do
I just believe in myself, 'cause no one else is trueEvery day just comes and goes
Life is one big overdose
People try to ruin me
And I can't seem to eliminate themPeople riding their real pace
Keep on running their rat race
Behind each flower grows a weed
In their world of make-believe 
Leading us on, to the land of Eternity
Riding the cold cold winds of ValhallaThe Kingdom of Odin is the Kingdom of Gods
Where only souls of the brave may rest in peace
But someone among them had the skill of deceit
And raised the hand that would open the road to Hell[Chorus]
When the winds of Valhalla run cold
Be sure that the blood will start to flow
When the winds of Valhalla run cold
ValhallaThe ring has been broken and a soul must be saved
Among the bravest of men, who rides to Hell
The long ships are sailing and the chariots ride
And yes the anger of Thor will serve you well[Chorus]Raise your hands
Reach and Valhalla will save your soul
Raise your eyes
And Odin will lead us onThey say that history repeats itself
Upon the year of the seventh Century
Well nobody knows no you never can tell
So you'd better run now and hide away[Chorus] 
Generals gathered in their masses
Just like witches at black masses
Evil minds that plot destruction
Sorcerers of death's construction
In the fields the bodies burning
As the war machine keeps turning
Death and hatred to mankind
Poisoning their brainwashed minds
Oh lord yeah!Politicians hide themselves away
They only started the war
Why should they go out to fight?
They leave that role to the poorYeahTime will tell on their power minds
Making war just for fun
Treating people just like pawns in chess
Wait 'till their judgment day comes
Yeah! 
Now the first day that I met ya
I was looking in the sky
When the sun turned all a blur
And the thunderclouds rolled byThe sea began to shiver
And the wind began to moan
It must've been a sign for me
To leave you well aloneI was born without you, baby

And watch you slowly take away
A love I've never knownI was born without you, baby
But my feelings were a little bit too strong
Just a little bit too strong 
Long ago I wandered thru my mind
In the land of fairy tales and stories
Lost in happiness I knew no fears
Innocence and love was all I knew
It was an illusionSoon the days were passing into years
Happiness just didn't come so easy
Life was more than fairy tales and daydreams
Innocence was just another word
It was an illusionLost in the wheels of confusion
Running thru valleys of tears
Eyes full of angry delusion
Hiding in everyday fearsSo I found that life is just a game
But you know there's never been a winner
Try your hardest, you'll still be a loser
The world will still be turning when you're gone
Yeah, when you're gone 
Long ago I wandered thru my mind
In the land of fairy tales and stories
Lost in happiness I knew no fears
Innocence and love was all I knew
It was an illusionSoon the days were passing into years
Happiness just didn't come so easy
Life was more than fairy tales and daydreams
Innocence was just another word
It was an illusionLost in the wheels of confusion
Running thru valleys of tears
Eyes full of angry delusion
Hiding in everyday fearsSo I found that life is just a game
But you know there's never been a winner
Try your hardest, you'll still be a loser
The world will still be turning when you're gone
Yeah, when you're gone 
Accept the fact that you're second rate life is easy for you
It's all served up on a gold plated plate
And we don't even have to talk to you
Your face is normal that's the way you're bred
And that's the way you're going to stay
Your head is firmly nailed to your TV channel
But someone else's finger's on the control panelWhat you gonna be brother - Zero the hero
Don't you want to be brother - Zero the hero
When you gonna be brother - Zero the hero
Impossibility impissibolity mother really a heroYou sit there watch it all burn down
It's easy and breezy for you
You play your life to a different sound
No edge no edge you got no knife have you
Your life is a six lane highway to nowhere
You're going so fast you're never ever gonna get down there
Where the heroes sit by the river
With a magic in their music as they eat raw liverYou stand there captain we all look
You really are mediocre
You are the champion in the Acme form book
But I think you're just a joker
Your freedom life ain't so much of a pity
But the luv-a-duckin' way you're walkin' around
The city with your balls and your head full of nothing
It's easy for you sucker but you really need stuffing 
What is this that stands before me?
Figure in black which points at me
Turn around quick, and start to run
Find out I'm the chosen one
Oh noBig black shape with eyes of fire
Telling people their desire
Satan's sitting there, he's smiling
Watches those flames get higher and higher
Oh no, no, please god help me!Is it the end, my friend?
Satan's coming 'round the bend
People running 'cause they're scared
The people better go and beware
No, no, please, no 
Now the first day that I met ya
I was looking in the sky
When the sun turned all a blur
And the thunderclouds rolled byThe sea began to shiver
And the wind began to moan
It must've been a sign for me
To leave you well aloneI was born without you, baby

And watch you slowly take away
A love I've never knownI was born without you, baby
But my feelings were a little bit too strong
Just a little bit too strong 
Vengence cupped within the flower
Deadly petals with strange power
Faces shine a deadly smile
Look upon you at your trialChill that numbs from head to toe
Icy sun with frosty glow
Words that go read to your sorrow
Words that go read no tomorrowFeel your spirit rise with the breeze
See your body falling to it's knees
Sleeping wall of remorse
Turns your body to a corpse
Turns your body to a corpse
Turns your body to a corpse
Sleeping wall of remorse
Turns your body to a corpseNow from darkness there springs light
Wall of sleep is cool and bright
Wall of sleep is lying broken
Sun shines in you have awoken 
Mr. Crowley, what went down in your head
(Oh) Mr. Crowley, did you talk to the dead
Your lifestyle to me seems so tragic
With the thrill of it all
You fooled all the people with magic
(Yeah)You waited on Satan's callMr. Charming, did you think you were pure
Mr. Alarming, in nocturnal rapport
Uncovering things that were sacred, manifest on this earth
(Oh)Conceived in the eye of a secret
Yeah, they scattered the afterbirthSoloMr. Crowley, won't you ride my white horse?
Mr. Crowley, it's symbolic of course
Approaching a time that is classic
I hear that maidens call
Approaching a time that is drastic
Standing with their backs to the wall(Solo)Was it polemically sent?
I wanna know what you meant
I wanna know
I wanna know what you meant, yeah! 
I've seen a look of evil in your eyes
You've been filling me all full of lies
Sorrow will not change your shameful deeds
Do well best, someone else has better seenEvil woman, don't you play your games with me
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me

Turn around quick, and start to run
Find out I'm the chosen one
Oh noBig black shape with eyes of fire
Telling people their desire
Satan's sitting there, he's smiling
Watches those flames get higher and higher
Oh no, no, please god help me!Is it the end, my friend?
Satan's coming 'round the bend
People running 'cause they're scared
The people better go and beware
No, no, please, no 
Now the first day that I met ya
I was looking in the sky
When the sun turned all a blur
And the thunderclouds rolled byThe sea began to shiver
And the wind began to moan
It must've been a sign for me
To leave you well aloneI was born without you, baby
But my feelings were a little bit too strongYou never said you love me
And I don't believe you can
'Cause I saw you in a dream
And you were with another manYou looked so cool and casual
And I tried to look the same
But now I've got to know ya
Tell me who am I to blame?I was born without you, baby
But my feelings were a little bit too strongNow the whole wide world is movin'
'Cause there's iron in my heart
I just can't keep from cryin'
'Cause you say we've got to partSorrow grips my voice as I stand here all alone
And watch you slowly take away
A love I've never knownI was born without you, baby
But my feelings were a little bit too strong
Just a little bit too strongNow the whole wide world is movin'
'Cause there's iron in my heart
I just can't keep from cryin'
'Cause say we've got to partSorrow grips my voice as I stand here all alone
And watch you slowly take away
A love I've never knownI was born without you, baby
But my feelings were a little bit too strong
Just a little bit too strong 
Vengence cupped within the flower
Deadly petals with strange power
Faces shine a deadly smile
Look upon you at your trialChill that numbs from head to toe
Icy sun with frosty glow
Words that go read to your sorrow
Words that go read no tomorrowFeel your spirit rise with the breeze
See your body falling to it's knees
Sleeping wall of remorse
Turns your body to a corpse
Turns your body to a corpse
Turns your body to a corpse
Sleeping wall of remorse
Turns your body to a corpseNow from darkness there springs light
Wall of sleep is cool and bright
Wall of sleep is lying broken
Sun shines in you have awoken 
Mr. Crowley, what went down in your head
(Oh) Mr. Crowley, did you talk to the dead
Your lifestyle to me seems so tragic
With the thrill of it all
You fooled all the people with magic
(Yeah)You waited on Satan's callMr. Charming, did you think you were pure
Mr. Alarming, in nocturnal rapport
Uncovering things that were sacred, manifest on this earth
(Oh)Conceived in the eye of a secret
Yeah, they scattered the afterbirthSoloMr. Crowley, won't you ride my white horse?
Mr. Crowley, it's symbolic of course
Approaching a time that is classic
I hear that maidens call
Approaching a time that is drastic
Standing with their backs to the wall(Solo)Was it polemically sent?
I wanna know what you meant
I wanna know
I wanna know what you meant, yeah! 
I've seen a look of evil in your eyes
You've been filling me all full of lies
Sorrow will not change your shameful deeds
Do well best, someone else has better seenEvil woman, don't you play your games with me
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me

See all


Now I know just what you're looking for
You want me to claim that child you bore
Well, you know that it must he not be
And you know the way it got to beEvil woman, don't you play your games with me
Evil woman, don't you play your games withEvil woman, don't you play your games with me
Evil woman, don't you play your games with meWickedness lies in your moisten lips
Your body moves just like the crack of a whip
Blackness sleeps on top of your stray bed
Do you wish that you could see me deadEvil woman, don't you play your games with me
Evil woman, don't you play your games with meEvil woman, don't you play your games with me
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me 
Well I don't want no demon to tell me what it's all about
No black magician telling me to get my soul out
Don't believe in violence, I don't even believe in peace
I've opened the door and my mind has been releasedWell I don't want no preacher telling me about the god in the sky
No I don't want no one to tell me where I'm gonna go when I die
I want to live my life with no people telling me what to do
I just believe in myself, 'cause no one else is trueEvery day just comes and goes
Life is one big overdose
People try to ruin me
And I can't seem to eliminate themPeople riding their real pace
Keep on running their rat race
Behind each flower grows a weed
In their world of make-believe 
Generals gathered in their masses
Just like witches at black masses
Evil minds that plot destruction
Sorcerers of death's construction
In the fields the bodies burning
As the war machine keeps turning
Death and hatred to mankind
Poisoning their brainwashed minds
Oh lord yeah!Politicians hide themselves away
They only started the war
Why should they go out to fight?
They leave that role to the poorYeahTime will tell on their power minds
Making war just for fun
Treating people just like pawns in chess
Wait 'till their judgment day comes
Yeah! 
Sometimes I feel like I'm dying at dawn
And sometimes I'm warm as fire
But lately I feel like I'm just gonna rain
And it goes over, and over, and over again, yeahToo many flames, with too much to burn
And life's only made of paper
Oh, how I need to be free of this pain
But it goes over, and over, and over, and over againYeah, sometimes I cry for the lost and alone
And for their dreams that will all be ashes
But lately I feel like I'm just gonna rain
And it goes over, and over, and over, and over again(Over)
(Over) 
Instrumental 
Red sun rising in the sky
Sleeping village, cockerels cry
Soft breeze blowing in the trees
Peace of mind, feel at ease 
Instrumental 
Long ago I wandered thru my mind
In the land of fairy tales and stories
Lost in happiness I knew no fears
Innocence and love was all I knew
It was an illusionSoon the days were passing into years
Happiness just didn't come so easy
Life was more than fairy tales and daydreams
Innocence was just another word
It was an illusionLost in the wheels of confusion
Running thru valleys of tears
Eyes full of angry delusion
Hiding in everyday fearsSo I found that life is just a game
But you know there's never been a winner
Try your hardest, you'll still be a loser
The world will still be turning when you're gone
Yeah, when you're gone 
A childhood innocence was drowned in your tears
The demons that you fought are feeding your fears
The poisoned secrets of your life stand revealed
The truth destroys you, its no longer concealedDear father forsaken, you knew what you were doing
In silence your violence has left my life in ruin
Yeah, in ruin, yeahYou preyed upon my flesh then prayed for my soul
Belief betrayed by lust, the faith that you stole
Indoctrination by a twisted desire
The catechism of an evil messiahDear father forgive me, I know just what I'm doing
In silence this violence will leave your life in ruin
Yeah, in ruin, yeahPreacher of theocracy hiding your hypocrisy
Under false sanctity, holy phoney empathy
You have taken my life
Now it's your turn to dieCan you sleep at night? when you close your eyes
Do you think of all the pain from your lies?
Or do you deny you're responsible
For the victims of the sins you devised?What you gonna tell them when they ask you? well then
Is your conscience pure in your heart?
There is no exemption when you seek redemption
For all the lives that you've torn apartYour molestations of the cross you defiled
A man once holy now despised and reviled
You took possession while confessing my sins
And now you have to face whatever death brings, yeahDear father forsaken, you knew what you were doing
In silence your violence has left my life in ruin, yeah
In ruin, yeah, yeah, yeah
In ruin yeah
