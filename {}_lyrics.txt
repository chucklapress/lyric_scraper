Baby if you flatter me, you might get somewhere
But I ain't gonna flatter you 'coz I don't really care
Ain't it all, ain't it all amusingNow, now maybe if you get the sign, I might be a man
Baby you forgot the time, I'll do the best I can
Ain't it all, ain't it all, ain't it all amusing
Well, ain't it all, right, right, ain't it all amusingMake me laugh.....
Hey, Jack and Jill went up the hill
To fetch a pail of water
Jill fell down and broke her crown
And that's the way it oughta.....
Well, ain't it all now, all now, all, ain't it all amusing
I say, ain't it all, right, ain't it all amusingOh, oh yeah
Oh, Baby if you flatter me, you might get somewhere
But I ain't gonna flatter you 'coz I don't really care
Ain't it all, ain't it all amusing
Ha-ha
Well, ain't it all, right, right, ain't it all amusing
All amusing 
There's perfect harmony
In the rising and the falling of the sea
And as we sail along
I never fail to be astounded by the things we'll do for promises
And a songWe are the innocent
We are the damned
We were caught in the middle of the madness
Hunted by the lion and the lamb oh, ohWe bring you fantasy
We bring you pain
It's your one great chance for a miracle
Or we will disappear
Never to be seen againAnd all the fools sailed away
All the fools sailed away
Sailed awayWe bring you beautiful
We teach you sin
We can give you a piece of the universe
Or we will disappear
Never to return againAnd all the fools sailed away
All the fools sailed away
All the fools sailed away
They sailed away
Sailed awayAnd as we drift along
I never fail to be astounded by the things we'll do for promises
And a songWe are the innocent
We cut we bleed
We're your one great chance for a miracle
And a miracle is something you needThey'll take your diamonds
And then give you steel
You'll be caught in the middle of the madness
Just lost like them
And part of all the pain that they feel, yeahAnd all the fools sailed away
All the fools sailed away
All the fools sailed away
Leaving nothing, nothing more to say
All the fools sailed awayThey say you're beautiful
And they'll always let you in
But doors are never open
To the child without a trace of sinSail away 
Remember when you only needed no one
Every day's tomorrow
And it's all right
No confessions - not for you
Forget the things you've done
It's what you'll doThe first time you're suspicious
What's that gliding down
Along comes a spiderSuddenly the world has no more changes
You've run with an evil woman
So it's all right
No more strangers' candy lies
The light is so much better for your eyesNow I'm not superstitious
But every time you've tried
Along comes a spiderDon't ask why - it's the long way around
Just go wildWhy do we believe in conversation
We never seem to listen
We only hearNow you don't need permission
But don't get caught next time
Along comes a spider
A spider
A spider
Inside her

Aggravatin' Annie you're getting on my fanny
And I just can't cope any more
When it gets down to fundamentals
You're a bit confusingYou've got wrinkles on your face
But they seem to be in place
So I wonder well I wonder
Are you leading the young boy on?
Annie New OrleansYou're a hard core woman, a red necked woman
A good old girl from the South
With a negative way of speaking
But you're sentimentalWe never speak of life but you want to be my wife
And I wonder, well I wonder
Are you leading the young boy on?
Annie New OrleansWell didn't think I heard you at all
I was starting to fall
Back it up and try it again
I ain't letting you win, no way, all rightAggravatin' Annie you're on my fanny
And I can't cope any more
When it gets down to fundamentals
Lady, you're confusingWell, you've got some wrinkles on your face
But they're all in their place
So I wonder, I just wonder
Well are you leading the young boy on?
Annie New Orleans
Hey, Annie New Orleans
Oh, hey, Annie New OrleansYeah 
She's a rumor in the night
It's crazy
You can see her but she isn't there
She's the stealer of the light
It's crazy
But you go anywhere
It was just a summer night
Maybe
When a shiver cut across the air
Should you run and get away
Maybe
To go where-where-where
She crouches the hunter
Ready to tell you
Another lie
Another lie
You could see the side of someday
Feel the power of the young and strong
You were learning how to fly someway
You were wrong-wrong-wrong
She jumped at the moment
A chance to tell you
Another lie
It was just a summer night
Maybe
When a shiver cut across the air
Should you run and get away
Maybe
To go where-where-where
She jumps at the moment
She crouches the hunter yeah
You look and you know she's telling you
Another lie
Another lie
Why it's crazy
When you feel you're getting stronger
Why it's crazy
All the lies are getting longer
Another lie
Another lie 
Someone had a dream
Never been to London
Never in a limousineSomething made him go
Could it be the voices
Coming from the radioBut somewhere down the line
The happiness you'll find
Will crash into a wall
Just before the fallSomeone joined the band
But he never heard the music
Couldn't really understand
No, no noDon't know what they mean
Where's my picture
Shining from a magazineBut somewhere down the line
He'll quickly glance behind
Then smash into a wall
Before the fallSomeone ran so fast
When he saw the future
He was sure that it was just the pastSomeone had a dream
Only this one ended lost
Inside the old machineAnd somewhere down the line
They'll say that his is mine
And all that's left is time
Time to fall and stumble, ah 
I'm all right- I'm crossing over
I just shot the sun
One more night black as heaven
So no-one saw the gunRunning with monsters in shadows
And monsters always know
It's better in the darkOh, she's all right - tall and handsome
If the lights are down
Gone by dawn - takes no chances
Might come back aroundClutching to monsters in shadows
And monsters always know
It's better in the darkI'm all right I'm crossing over
I can disappear goneClutching to monsters in shadows
And monsters always know
It's better in the dark
Better in the dark
I just shot the sun 
She never breaks into the conversation
He seems to be the reason why she lives
She tries to be the perfect kind of stranger
But we always seem to love the most
The ones who never give, yeahIt's between two hearts
A personal situation
Between two hearts
The kind of love with a reputationWe never have to ask her why she's crying
The smile she has been kicked into a frown
But still it makes her day to be his pleasure
Should we open up her eyes
Can we ever break the spell
No one can tellIt's between two hearts
A personal combination
Between too hearts
The kind of love with a bad reputationPut on your party faces and come along
Join in the big parade
Here comes the camera
Do you look as good as your sister
Smile at the animals
They should be the ones in the cages
Turn the pagesAnother way to spend a rainy Sunday
Waiting for a call that never comes
The mystery is how she makes her choices
But don't we always choose
The ones who hide the sun
EveryoneIt's between two hearts
Love and desperation
Between two hearts
The kind of love
The kind of loveBetween two hearts
A personal situation
Between two hearts
The kind of love with a reputation 
Who controls your mindThere have been changes
No more giving it all for free
There will be changes
Now woman is all you need

We will be watching
One might fall but you'll all be blamed

Black 
Oh yeah
Uh back in the wood
Where it's good
And the days are yellow
Well I saw me a child
She was wild
Like a lady going all outDark as the night
She was ripe
For a little conversation
So I pulled her right in
And she said
She had some imaginationBlack swampy water
That's where I caught her
Black swampy water
Black swampy waterWe didn't speak
For a week
Got tangled up in her hair
So we lay in the grass
What a gas
You can't know that you were thereSo then I let it all go
And the show
Was like blowing up a freight train
And round the world I would go
Like jumping on a jet planeBlack swampy water
That's where I caught her
Black swampy water
Uh, what I taught her, yeahOh, back in the wood
Where it's good
And the days are yellow
Gotta saw me a child
She was wild
Like a lady going all outI've been
Black swampy water
All right
That's where I caught her, oh
Black swampy water
Oh all the things that I taught her
Yes, againBlack swampy water, my my
Where I saw here, oh
Black swampy water
What I did when I caught her, oh yeah yeah 
Rainy days, rainy days
Too many rainy days
It's been found you can't get brown
Rain go away[First four lines repeated 2 times]Rainy days, rainy days
Too many rainy days[Last two lines repeated 8 times] 
Oh, you've been surprised again
Pulled like a leaf to the waterfall
Everybody's just pretending
I thought that you'd learn by nowOoh, think about it one more time
What have you got when the god is gone
Clouds don't have a silver lining
And all you ever get is rain'Cause you can't get blood from a stone
You can't open the door if there's nobody home
They've taken it all so just leave me alone
You can't get blood from a stoneIt isn't once upon a time
When nobody falls and the hero flies
That victims got to fit the crime
And nobody goes down with you
You, you!'Cause you can't get blood from a stone
You can't open the door if there's nobody home
They've taken it all so just leave me alone
You can't get blood from a stone
No, no'Cause you can't get blood from a stone
You can't open the door if there's nobody home
They've taken it all so just leave me alone
No, you can't get blood from a stoneNo blood from a stone
Go on and leave me alone
And I know it's a shock
To learn that you can't
You can't, you can't get blood from a rock 
There's a crack in the rainbow
There's a hole in the sky
You believed in something
Now it's just a lie, yeahNo jokes from the jester
Not a laugh from the clown
And your world is upside down, yeahYou can hide in a circle
It's a way to survive
Be another number
At least you'd be aliveOr you can ride with the gypsy
He can take you to hell
And the answers screaming
In a voice you know so wellYou you're made of fire
Never higher
You were made to runYou you're burning higher
You've got the fire
You were born on the sunSo take a walk with a wild one
It's the way that I've found
You can turn it upside down 
No no no no no no no, you said a single word
But no one really heard
Sometimes we scream aloneIt's always worse at night
When darkness kills the light
We're in the danger zoneYou wait with pounding heart
You know it's just the start'Cause you're breathless, ready to burn
Breathless, the circle still turns
Breathless, willing to learn
You're breathless, yeahLiving inside your mind
Who knows the things you'll find
There could be hell or rainbowsBut it's a funny thing
The more you feel the sting
You're just a leaf that the wind blowsYou've been this way before
One step and you're through the doorAnd you're breathless, ready to burn
Breathless, the circle still turns
Breathless, you willing to learn
Breathless oh yeah alrightYou said a single word
But no one really heard
Sometimes we scream aloneIt's always worse at night
When darkness kills the light
We're in the danger zoneYou wait with pounding heart
You know it's just the start'Cause you're breathless, ready to burn
Breathless, the circle still turns
Breathless, willing to learn
You're breathless, yeahYou're breathless alone in the light
Breathless, but the feeling is right
Breathless, ready to burn
You're breathless
Said a single but no one really heard
It's always worse at night
'Cause when darkness kills the light, then you're breathless
Yeah, you're breathless, ready to burn
You're breathless, you're willing to learn
Breathless, while the circle still turns
You're breathless, breathless
Breathless alone in the night, breathless the feeling ain't right?
Breathless, I'm ready to burn I'm ready to burn 
Did you ever believe in your dreams before
Were you always afraid of the dark
Is the edge of the world always in your head
Does the gun point straight at your heartIt used to come just when you sleep
But now, it's only a shout awayYou always seem to find the sun
But this time, the sun is a fire
Bring down the rain
This house is burning again
Put out the flame
Bring down the rainYou were told that the storm would just roll on by
That the thunder was made in your mind
And the heat in the night was to keep you warm
And the truth could be told by a lair nowYou always seem to find the light
But this time, the light is a fire
Bring down the rain
This house is burning again
Put down the flame
Bring down the rainShake up, break up, everybody make up
Everything's always the same
Trapped down, trapped down, everybody back down
Bring down the rainYou always seem to find the light
But this time, the light is a fire
Bring down the rain
This house is burning again
Don't play the game
Bring down the rain
Put out the flame
Bring down the rainIt's the shake up, break up, everybody make up
Well, it's always the same
Trapped down, cracked down, everybody back down
Won't you bring down all the rain 
Well just imagine my surprise to be there
If you touched me with a feather I'd fall
I guess that you could say we finally made it
We played the Carolina County BallWe had the ladies all in line to see us
I must have promised twenty seven I'd call
We thought the sun was never gonna stop shining
On the Carolina County BallWe played it hot, hard and nasty, oh yeah
At the Carolina County Ball

Looking inside of yourself
You might see someone you don't know
Maybe it's just what you need
Letting the river in you flowYou can sail away to the sun
And let it burn you while you can
Or walk a long bloody road
Like the hero who never ranYou'll feel it
You'll feel it
You'll feel the rush of it allFlying away int the clouds
You know you're loosing your control
And finding you way in the dark
Like some poor forgotten soulYou'll feel it

In the misty morning, on the edge of time
We've lost the rising sun, a final sign
As the misty morning rolls away to die
Reaching for the stars, we blind the skyWe sailed across the air before we learned to fly
We thought that it could never end
We'd glide above the ground before we learned to run, run
Now it seems our world has come undoneOh they say that it's over
And it just had to be
Ooh they say that it's over
We're lost children of the sea, ohWe made the mountains shake with laughter as we played
Hiding in our corner of the world
Then we did the demon dance and rushed to nevermore
Threw away the key and locked the doorOh they say that it's over, yeah
And it just had to be
Yes they say that it's over
We're lost children of the seaIn the misty morning, on the edge of time
We've lost the rising sun, a final sign
As the misty morning rolls away to die
Reaching for the stars, we blind the skyOh they say that it's over, yeah
And it just had to be
Oh they say that it's over
Poor lost children of the sea, yeahLook out! The sky is falling down!
Look out! The world is spinning round and round and round!
Look out! The sun is going black, black
Look out! It's never never never coming back, look out! 
Tired of living in the black and white?
Where fools can tell you that you're never right
I know a place where the film's in color
Just step inside of yourself
Here's a place in the front row
So on with the showThe same old shadow on the run
That's no shadow, it's your shadow's sonI know a place where the pools got water
And you don't need to know how to swim
Here's the key to the back door
Do you want more
Do you need more?Same old rhythm to the same old rhyme
The same old clock - same old timeThere's a place where the grass is greener
And you can shake, rattle and roll
Here's the key to the front door
Do you want more
Will you need more?Tired of living in the black and white
Where no-one's wrong and you're never right
Same old steps to the same old dance
Just one more reason - one more chance
Oh 
Waiting for the revolution
New clear vision, genocide
Computerize God, it's the new religion
Program the brain, not the heartbeatOnward all you crystal soldiers
Touch tomorrow, energize
Digital dreams
And you're the next correction
Man's a mistake so we'll fix it, yeahTake a look at your own reflection
Right before your eyes
It turns to steel[Chorus:]
There's another side of heaven
This way, to technical paradise
Find it on the other side
When the walls fall downLove is automatic pleasure
Virtual reality
Terminal hate, it's a calculation
Send in the child for connectionTake a look at the toys around you
Right before your eyes
The toys are real[Chorus]Midnight confessions
Never heal the soul
What you believe is fantasyYour past is your future
Left behind
Lost in time
Will you surrenderWaiting for the revolution
Program the brain
Not the heartbeatDeliver us to evil
Deny us of our faith
Robotic hearts bleed poison
On the world we populateVirtual existence
With a superhuman mind
The ultimate creation
Destroyer of mankindTermination of our youth
For we do not compute
No! 
One night when the stars were right
For the gypsy queen
And she found she could drog you down
To a place that's in - between it all she's a
Madman with a delicate hand and evil eyes
And I've heard she'll only say a word
And that's enough to satisfyDon't ask why
Don't even think about it
Brave men die
But what a way to goShe's not above
Death by loveOne spell from the wishing well
And you're nevermore
Bad start for the sacred heart
Cause the end has come before the beginningKnee deep in the darkest sleep
But the eyes see all
So high you could break the sky
And never feel the fall to comeStrong men die
But what a way to goShe's not above
Death by loveDon't ask why
Don't even think about it
Brave men die
But what a way to goYou've got symptoms of
Death by love
She's not above
Death by loveDon't ask why
Don't even guess about it
All men die
But this is death by love

Please, please, make love freeze
And break apart in the middle (of it)?
Then they could see the hate
When they separate
And taste the salt of their tearsNo, no, it's all about experience
Control, you might as well be wood, no goodWhy why, your questions die
In a shout and no attention
You might have said
That they both were dead
So put the puzzle awayBut no, it's all about experience
Control, they're gonna give you none, no funDon't tell the kids, they'll never understand it
Don't tell the kids, don't waste your time, noGet back, it's a heart attack
And the planet needs a doctor
We can tell it looks like hell
But they make us close our eyesNo, it's all about experience
And control, you might as well be stone, aloneDon't tell the kids, they'll never understand it
Don't tell the kids, don't waste your time, yeahDon't tell the kids, they'll never get the picture
Don't tell the kids, you waste your time, yeahDon't tell the kids, they just don't understand it
Don't tell the kids, don't waste your time, timeTalk to the animals
Anyone who'll answer
Any fool will do
Just don't tell the kids 
When you're alone and the sun's gone down
One more time
Must you pretend that some light still shines
Sounds like double Monday
YeahEach time you think that you've just begun
It's the end
Oh, someone you love wants to just be friends
Sounds like double Monday
YeahFeels like snakes and spiders
Crawling up your body
Every someday double MondayLike a fly against the wall
Just when you think you've seen it all you
You lose your special place to hide
So get ready for the ride, ride, ride
Yeah 
All's well at the midnight hour
You're ready to fly
Don't think about the darkness
Or the rumbling in the skySomewhere on the morning road
Just waiting for you
Somethings that just could never be
Are calling up a spell so you can see, yeah!Dream evil
The dark that you find in the back of your mind
Dream evil, dream evilDon't go to the edge of rainbows
Don't close your eyes
Like things that can't be real
The truth is really liesDon't wish on a rising star you could
Open up the door
Where things that just should never be
Are calling up a spell so you can see, yeah!Dream evil
The dark that you find
Can come out of your mind
Dream evil
Take you awayOh no it's the midnight hour
Don't leave me aloneThose things that just should never be
Are calling up a spell so you can seeDream evil
(Dream evil)Oh no it's the midnight hour
Don't open the door
Don't go to the edge of rainbows
Don't sleep any more
You'll dream evil
You'll dream evil
You'll dream evil
Dream evil 
Instrumental 
Once upon a high
The streets were gold and blue was
In the sky riders gone
Never could belong
Maybe you still can dream
Sleep through screams
While we're dying in AmericaOnce upon a child
The carnival would stop and stay a
While you were gone
Everything went wrong
Too soon, cartoon
Dying in America
Dying in AmericaIn places where aces outnumber the queens
Jack is afraid of tomorrow
Colors are changing to red, white and green
As we all fall downOnce upon a hate
They told us they could fix it if we'd
Wait for awhile
Killing you with smiles
Maybe you still can dream
Sleep through screams
While we're dying in America
Dying in America 
In the land of the lost horizon
Where the queen lies dark and cold
And when the stars won't shine, then the story's told yeahWhen the world was milk and honey
And the magic was strong and true
Then the strange ones came and the people knewThat the chains are on
That the chains are onMy, my, my in the land of no tomorrow

Come and sail on my golden sea
Maybe one day you'll be just like me and that's freeBut still your chains are on
Yes your chains are on
Still your chains are onYou've seen them walking on the water
You've seen flying through the sky
They were frightening in the darkness
They had rainbows in their eyesWhen the world was milk and honey
And the magic was strong and true
The the strange ones came and the people knewYeah that the chains are on
(That the chains are on)That the chains are on in the land of the lost horizon
Where the chains are on
In the land of world was milk and honey
Still your chains are on
Where the queen lies dark and lonely

And the world was new and magic
But the chains are on, and the chains are on
Oh the chains are on

And the chains are on, see them flying through the sky
They we're frightening in the darkness (yes chains are on)
They had rainbows in their eyes (the chains are on) 
In the land of the lost horizon
Where the queen lies dark and cold
And when the stars won't shine, then the story's told yeahWhen the world was milk and honey

And then the darkIve been way beyond your universe
And Ive seen things that I should never tell
But here I go again I just cant keep it to myself
The story of my world and how I fellRound and round
The square inside the circle
And still I shake the same
At the rhythm of her nameElectra
ElectraI believed in love and miracles
So how can I be blamed for what Ive done?
And if its still a sin to hide the best parts for yourself
Then I have sinned but only just begunTheres no thunder, no lightning
Just a gentle breeze
To warn you that something
Will bring you to your kneesRound and round
Youre caught inside the circle
Still I shake the same
At the mention of her nameElectra
ElectraHey, Ive been way beyond your universe
And Ive come back to introduce to you
The fear of the heart, just try to keep it from yourself
And it will be the last thing that you'll doRound and round
Youre caught inside a circle
And you will shake the same
At the magic of her nameElectra
ElectraI am here to show my changes
Not to change what Ive become, no, no
Im not alone and she will testify
That its the best thing that Ive done, oh, oh, forElectra
Electra 
Now that my dreams have gone dead
I see them burning in the fire
Just like the words that I've said
Ashes turned to ashes once againLook for a sign in the air
A light that dances in the sky
Maybe you'll see it somewhere
Oh, shining like a diamond
Promising that hope will never dieI might know the answer
Well, it's back there in my brain
Someday soon I'll be rising again
Higher than the sunI have been father and son
I cry for children of the night
Just because tears have begun
Beware of quiet voices
Thunder comes from silence - I am light 
Hide in the midnight
Turn out the lights you see them anyway
Sail into never
They follow wherever you can go
And take you to the places you don't know
No, noIt's the call of the city
The way the black's pretty to the purest heart
It's places of pleasure
They promise your treasure if you fly
And then there goes the soul of you and I
Oh do you ever think about the way
I caught the rainbow
I'll be there when fire makes you danceI'm gonna give you the look
That opens up the skies
I've got evil eyes
Evil eyes
Evil eyes
Evil eyes
Yes evil eyes
Ooh those eyes
Look high in the night time
Turn out the lights they see you anyway
Sail into never
They follow wherever you can go
Evil eyes
Evil eyes
Evil eyes
Evil eyes
Evil eyes
Evil eyes
Take your lies
Evil eyes
You're a thin disguise
For what you are
Evil eyes
Sail into never
They'll follow you forever
'Cos they're evil eyes
Evil - Evil - Evil - Evil - Evil - Evil - Evil Eyes 
Give me shelter shelter
I can face the day
Then I'll just fade away
Give me shelter

The fire starts to die
You open up your eyesFaces in the window
Noises in the night

And we are all divine

Screaming out alone in the night
Just a time and place
But it's real all rightWe are diamonds that shine without fire
We're climbing the stairs
Going down and never higherFallen angels
Going downSomething came to me in a dream
The crack of a gun and a bloody scream
The I could see the faces and why
I was holding the gun
And the world began to dieIt's a criminal world
And we all get to play
You're a criminal
Sins of the children
Never get washed awayWe're fallen angels
Goin' down
Fallen angels
Come gather roundScreaming out alone in the night
Just a time and place
But it's real all rightWe are diamonds that shine without fire
We are climbing the stairs
Going down and never higherWe're fallen angels
Fallen angels
Fallen angels 
Hiding in a corner
Waiting for the storm
Maybe they'll forget about me
Avoid connection
Still they say you always surrenderAll the smiling faces
Promising the sun
Another way of breaking you downAll is lost
Hope is dead
Feed my mind
Fill my headHope is gone
The spell's been said
Fill my mind
Feed my headAh
Waiting for my number
To climb upon the cross
Maybe they'll forget about me
Must avoid detection
But they say you'll still go downSafe in dreams
Away from where they are
Let me be nowhere
Just another starSafe in night
The shadows cloak their eyes
Take me to nowhere
Where everybody flies
Oh!All is lost
Hope is dead
Feed my mind

Lately when my demons drag the night across my eyes
I just can't seem to fight it anymore
Yield unto temptation and be ruler of the world
But it seems that I have heard that song beforeAnd the voices begin to sing, come homeI have seen some evil as I've walked upon the earth
But this is way beyond what eyes can see
Wicked is as wicked does and if I lose control
Is this the way that hell is gonna beHave I fallen too far to rise
Been burning too long in the fire
Then it all falls down, tearing the night awayIt must be, fever dreams
Fever dreams
Fever dreamsNow before my demons roll the night across my eyes
I tremble as I wait perhaps to sin
Yield unto temptation and be ruler of the world
And all I do is let the beast come inHave I fallen too far to rise
I've been standing too long in the fire
Let it all fall down
Tearing the night awayIt must be, fever dreams
From the outside, fever dreams
Oh, fever dreams
Fever dreams
Ooh-oohFever dreams
Fever dreams
Fever dreams
Fever dreams
Fever dreams
Fever dreams 
Who's that angry man I see
Is he coming closer
Well I'll just make believe
That I've never been afraidCrackle, Crackle,
You're all dead
Feel the heat from fireheadFrom spooky stories that he's read
They put pictures on his body
Living out a fantasy
To be the last one left alive, hah!Crackle, Crackle,
You're all dead
Feel the heat from fireheadHe's lost the instruction
No control
Suicide fever, he won't be much older
I know, won't go, awayWhat's that smoke that I can see
Rising from the ashes
Well, it seems that there will always be
Someone just like youCrackle, Crackle,
And you're all dead
Feel the heat from firehead, firehead, firehead! 
She heard this song before
Daddy's at the door
Just to say I love youPlease, please, don't let him in
Is it all beginning again tonight?
Somebody make it right!I say: Give her the gun!

Can anyone make it right?I say: Give him the gun!
Look at her run away

Though you've decided that our love is wrong
And think that we should part
It seems as though I have loved you so long
You'll always be in my heart.Is it a sin
Is it a crime
Loving you dear like I do
If it's a crime then I'm guilty
Guilty of loving you.Maybe I'm wrong dreaming of you
Dreaming the lonely night through
If it's a crime then I'm guilty
Guilty of dreaming of youWhat can I do
What can I say
After I've taken the blame?
You say we're through
You'll go your way
But I'll always feel just the same.

She was straight from hell
But you never could tell
'Cause you were blinded by her light
She could crack your brain
With magic pain
And turn a paler shade of whiteWell I was on the free
Just me and me
And just about to sailWhen I heard the voice
Said you got a choice
The hammer or the nailYou'll be ridin'
You'll be ridin' on the gypsy
On the gypsyWell I rolled the bones
To see who'd own
My mind and what's withinAnd it's a given rule
That we're all fools
And need to have a little sinSo I'm ridin'
Well I'm ridin' on the gypsy
On the gypsy queenWell she was straight from hell
But you never could tell
'Cause you were blinded by the lightSo she cracked my brain
With magic pain
And turned my left around to right, rightSo I'm ridin'
I'm still ridin'
Yes I'm ridin' on the gypsy
On the gypsy queen
She's mean 
Sing me a song, you're a singer
Do me a wrong, you're a bringer of evil
The devil is never a maker
The less that you give, you're a taker
So it's on and on and on, it's heaven and hell
Oh wellThe lover of life's not a sinner
The ending is just a beginner
The closer you get to the meaning
The sooner you'll know that you're dreaming
So it's on and on and on, oh it's on and on and on
It goes on and on and on, Heaven and Hell
I can tell
Fool, foolOh uh
Yeah, yeah, yeahWell if it seems to be real, it's illusion
For every moment of truth, there's confusion in life
Love can be seen as the answer, but nobody bleeds for the dancer
And it's on and on, on and on and on and on and on and on and onThey say that life's a carousel
Spinning fast, you've got to ride it well
The world is full of kings and queens
Who blind your eyes and steal your dreams
It's heaven and hell, oh wellAnd they'll tell you black is really white
The moon is just the sun at night
And when you walk in golden halls
You get to keep the gold that falls
It's heaven and hell, oh noFool, fool
You've got to bleed for the dancer
Fool, fool
Look for the answer
Fool, fool, fool 
Here's to you! Here's to me!
Masters of the universe
The curse of destinyAll for one, it's one for all
Now you can pull the trigger
As we're knocking down on the wall
When you finally shoot too high
The lie will always bring it down
You resurrection angels,
Look what we found
That the wheel goes around
So here's to you!Come on, raise the dead
Heads will roll
Cancel the infection
We can purify the soulDo the crime
Then write the law
There's no wrong you can change it where
A change you've never sawHey, you desperation angels
Here we found
That they all fell down
So
Here's to me! Here's to you!Here's to you! Here's to me!
Here's to reason!
Here's to me! Here's to you!
Raise the dead! Here's to freedom! 
How do you feel right now
How does it feel to be alone
How do you feel right now
Tell meHey angel - what's your situation
Hey angel - oh, ohWhere would you be right now
Waiting to taste your next tomorrow
Where would you be right now
Tell meWas the pain too strong to take it anymore
So you turned off all the lights and shut the doorHey angel - what's your destination

Hey angel - oh, oh - you're my angel, my angelHow do you feel right now
How does it feel to be alone, oh

Came to the sunset scene
To find out who's inside of me
Some lies I've never seen
But this one lies on the silver screen
In between real and dream

Hey liar, tell me your intentions are good
Knowing it could be a lie
I see how you rise
To question the eyes of anyone who promises painContagious, something like a virus of love
Making the pleasure seem realAnother killing by the villain
Another body on the ground
Here comes the master of destruction again
I knew you from the start
Hunter of the heartCat crazy, never the predictable one
Asleep in the sun now the strike
Possession today, then send it away
After all the joys in the takingAnother beating by the villain
Another angel fallen down
Here comes the master of destruction again
Perfect for the part
Hunter of the heartAnother burning by the devil
And another diamond turned to glass
Here comes the master of destruction again
I knew you from the start
Hunter of the heart
Hunter of the heart 
I think I'm through with just pretending
Knocking at a door
That I've been through before
Congratulations - at last you've seen my light
Now it's you against the nightI think I'm never coming after - after all
Now I've become the cat
Who always lets you know thatI Am I Am - stronger than the wind
I Am I Am sin
I Am I Am - stronger without you
I AmFor all the words gone unspoken
Silence isn't gold
Or the story's never told
Investigation - at last I've found my light
And we shineSo now I'm like the cat
Who always tells you this thatI Am I Am - stronger than the wind
I Am I Am sin
I Am I Am better without you
I AmI think I'm way outside illusion
Breaking down the door
That locked me in before
Congratulations - now that you've see my light - after allAnd when I become the cat
I'll always let you know thatI Am I Am - stronger than the wind
I Am I Am sin
I Am I Am - stronger without you
I AmI Am I Am - brighter than the sun
I Am I Am everyone
I Am I Am - better without you
I AmI Am I Am - stronger than before
I Am I Am more
I Am I Am - ready to go on
I Am 
Alright, Dark touches send rushed through the brain
Black's whiter, burns brighter than the flame
No shadows, just whispers in the wind
No faces, just places to begin
I just come seeking pleasure,
I hate the lightI speed at night, at night, alrightMy demons, they seem to disappear
No vision, I only see to hear
Protection, I never needed none
Direction, just nowhere near the sun
You've go some stairs to heaven,
You may be right
I only know in my world,
I hate the light(I speed at night)
Alrigth
Dark touches send rushed through the brain
Black's whiter, burns brighter than the flame
No shadows, just whispers in the wind
No faces, just places to beginYou've got some stair to heaven, you may be right
I only know in my world,
I hate the light I speed at nightI speed at night?
I speed at night, night, night, night
I speed at night, night, night, night
No shadows, no faces, just whispers in dark places
(I speed at night) 
I'm standing in the shadows now
You think I'm dead and gone somehow
When the morning comes
You'll see around
Baby you know
I'm coming back for you
I'm coming back for you
I'm coming back for youFeel like your time is coming fast
Keep hanging on you, you just gotta last
You're gonna see I won't forget you now
Oh, you know
I'm coming back for you
I'm coming back for you
I'm coming back for youDon't let the big world get you down
I'm gonna turn it all around
And when the morning comes
You'll see my face
I know
I'm coming back for you
I'm coming back for you, yes I do
I'm coming back for youOh, baby, come down
I'm, I'm, I'm coming back for you

Coming back for you
Lord, good God
Lord, good God, I'm coming back for you
Oh Lord 
Help me - save me
I've just crossed the line
Where reason might betray me
Wake me - shake me
Send a message to my brain
Before they take me
How can I get through to you
That wishes just come true
In dreamsDon't go - don't dare
Cause the journey drives you made
Before you get there
Help me - save me
I'll be glad to give you back
The hand you gave me
How can I get through to you
That wishes do come true
In dreamsIf I'm a river - then you're the sea
Somewhere you'll find me
Alone and swimming here in ecstasyIf I am silence - you must be scream
But I don't hear you
I'm in a place that I've just never seen before 
Inside the walls I've made
To keep out all who reach for me
I might have lost my way
And I can't come out againDon't come around here anymore
You may infect yourself
Don't ever cross this line
You could see monsters in your mind
There just like meHave I erased all sense of touch
I don't feel anything
Sometimes they say I need
Sometimes I think I need
Sometimes I know I need
New parts for my brainMost dreams, they're black and white
But I must color mine
Each day's another end
Less night of screaming
Shouting at the outside
Someone let me inSet me free now no-one can
Faces at the window
Stop the water, bags of sand
Institutional manSometimes they say I need
Sometimes I think I need
Sometimes I know I need
New parts for my brainSet me free now no-one can
Faces at the window
Lock the cages, tie my hands
Institutional, institutional man 
If your circle stays unbroken
Then you're a lucky man
'Cause it never, never, never has for meIn the palace of the virgin
Lies the chalice of the soul
And it's likely you might find the answer thereShe had thirteen years of teenage tears
And never a helping hand
She had fourteen more of rain before
She saw the sight of land
She was a photograph just ripped in half
A smile inside a frown
And the the light, the answer right
Inside her coming downIt said
I can go away
I can leave here
I can be invisible
I go awayHe was just eighteen and in-between
A lady and a man
His daddy's girl in momma's world
That was when he ran
You know the word confused has been abused
But that's just what he was
And then the spark inside the dark
The answer came because it saidYou can go away
You can leave here
You can be invisibleWell I grew up quick and I felt the kick
Of life upon a stage
So I bought the book and took a fast look
At just the very last page
It was a single word that I'd just heard
From the two that came before
The only way to really stay
Is to walk right out the doorSo you can go away
I'm gonna leave here
I can be invisibleAnd go away again
I can go away
When I leave here
I can be invisibleI said, when you can go away
Lord you know it's right to leave here
So I just become invisible
I went away
I disappeared before your eyes
You never touch me you never feel me
You'll never see me again
Because I've just become unseen
Well I'm a photograph that's been torn in half
We're all eighteen and we're in between
We need a helping hand to the holy land
To be invisible
To go away

They say eye for eye, tooth for tooth
But don't hurt your brother

Oh, I, I testify
They just showed me Mary
She was stoned, stoned, danger zone
There was nothing in her eyes
And then there, there in the air
Nailed to the cross was Jesus
Cross-road, overload
Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray my soul to keep away

You never sing for pleasure
You only make the sounds
You never feel the magic
'Cause you think the world is roundAnd you never dance in moonlight
You run but you never move
You don't believe in someday
And the truth is what you proveBut it's alright
Well, it's alright
Just another dayToo many chains around you
You laugh but you never smile
You don't belong in heaven
But you're here all the whileAnd it's alright
Well, it's alright
Just another day

Another way that they have found
Yes, another day, another way

Hey-hey
Oh my soul
Oh yeah 
Tonight we run
We can hide in the dark
When the moon steals the light from the dying sun
Oh run
It's a better thing than we have ever done
There's a beast that lives inside you
And it's screaming to get out
Like the beat of a heart
Don't look behind
Cause a tear that never dries
Can only make you blind
You've got to try
Cause the future's never never gonna die
There's a beast that lives inside you
And it's screaming to get out
It's a storm that's never ending
It's a truth without a doubt
Tonight we run
We can hide in the dark
Till the moon steals the light from the sun
There's a beast that lives inside you
And it's screaming let me out
It's a storm that's never ending
It's a truth without a doubt
Love can be a whisper
But pain will always
Shout to you
Like the beat of a heart
Like the beat of a heart
Like the beat of a heart
Like the beat of a heart
Go Beat your Heart 
When a milion miles from no where
Is still too close to home
You're with a hundred thousand people
And you still feel all aloneShe was never in the circle
Or the round would be a square
And the more she seemed to want it
The less they seemed to careSold out and no admission
Too late to buy
It's never who it's only why
She's living the lieWhen you're on your way to somewhere
But the elevator falls
Do you look for stairs to heaven
Or wander through the hallsHe was only dedicated
To the ones who make the law
But they burned with too much fire
And his heart was made of strawNo ticket - no admission
Too late to buy
It's always he and he knows why
He's living the lieBreak down
How bad do you want it
How far will you goIf you're looking at tomorrow
To forget about today
Then the past will be your future
And it's there you'll always stayWhat about the pictures
That smile from magazines
The ultimate temptation
Our new kings and all our queensSuch heat and too much pressure
Not worth the try
No more for them
Now it's I
And no more living the lie
Living the lie
Oh why
Live the lie 
In the houses of the holy
To the middle of the mystic sea
At the cradle of the worldThere's a black cat screaming
And it's not even midnight, no
At the cradle of the worldThey're screaming for sanctuary
They're screaming at you
Lock up the wolves
Lock up the wolves, yeah, yeah, yeahNow there's a cloud over heaven
And a pain out of paradise
In your corner of the worldTurn your back on the children
Does it feel like it's colder
In your corner of the worldThey're screaming for sanctuary
They're screaming at you
Lock up the wolves
Lock up the wolves,...Don't you let 'em get away
Lock up the wolves before you play
Or it's over
Lock up the wolves
Don't you let 'em get away
Don't you let 'em get awayThere's no back door to heaven
Just a front door to hell, oh
In this corner of the worldNow if you turn your back on the children
Don't you feel it getting colder

They're screaming at you
Lock up the wolves

Again 
It has been a thousand years since the once powerful planet of Blessing lost its life-giving two suns, and countless millennia since the days of the great magicians. An expedition of alien voyagers came upon the now ice-covered sphere, drawn there by an unexplained lone beacon far below the miles of frozen moisture, they unlocked a written history of Blessing from its almost undiscovered tomb. So begins the story of Magica.
It was a time of celebration. The Book of Magica and the wizards who had used its spells so wisely for the good of the people were being honored in all the great cities of the world. There was however an exception. Where good thrives, evil survives and evil has plans for survival.
The celebration of thanks and prosperity would signal the forces of Evilsyde to begin the attack and ultimate capture and destruction of Magica. The spells from the Book would be used to turn all of those unwilling to join Evilsyde into statues of stone and send their spirits to Otherworld, where they would eventually be assimilated into the energy needed to drive Evilsyde, and maintain its power without the necessity of the Book and its incantations forever.
Defenses were naturally relaxed during the festive preparations and although the battle was well-fought by both factions, the minions of the dark prevailed. Their assault was well-planned and executed to a fault. After overwhelming their initial opposition, they pushed on to the sacred ground upon which the Book of Magica rested. They possessed a much weaker form of magic themselves, and although it would be normally quite useless against the strength of Magica, the inability of the Wizards to gather themselves together in time, coupled with the perfect timing and determination of the attackers, spelled doom for the Book and its followers.
The leader of the insurrection was the high priest and executioner known as Shadowcast. His presence could make the naughtiest of children become obedient and inspire great fear among the adult population. This man, most vile, would now be ruler of all and answerable to none. His reign would plunge Blessing into eternal darkness and prepare the way for the coming of his master, Astoroth, the Grand Duke of Hell.
The capture of Magica did not, however, mean that Shadowcast had finally reached his goal. He must now find and conquer Blessing's Grand Wizard and legendary hero, Eriel. Eriel, who defeated Evilsyde time and again with his understanding and use of Magica's spells. He would be the last stumbling block of total domination.
Eriel had removed himself from the general population in anticipation of everlasting peace and now he devoted all of his energy to meditation and praise of his God. Lately though, he had been visited by many temptations in his dreams. Promises of pleasure, riches and power raced through his sleeping mind. All these lures had been placed there by Shadowcast, hoping to avoid confrontation between this dominant man and his own villainous forces. Eriel however had resisted these solicitations and was now warned of some impending danger. He managed to make his way to the sacred ground by cloaking his identity with simple spells, only to be discovered just before his attempt to rescue the Book of Magica, but not before he was able to memorize the most important of Magica's charms, The spell of Restoration.
The ceremony of thanksgiving was now directed toward the transmission of spirits to Otherworld. One by one the good souls of Blessing were turned to stone and sent on to their grisly fate, until only the noble Eriel remained. The spectacle that followed was meant to degrade Eriel and raise the courage of the cowardly supplicants of Evilsyde, but true to his indominantable bearing, he promised to return and banish Evilsyde forever. Then he was gone.
The horrors of Otherworld are now revealed to the masses huddled together for some small measure of comfort. First the adults were separated from their children amid cries and pleas for help. Next the old ones were taken away and assigned to a place very near the assimilation site. They were guarded by monstrous, misshapen denizens of this shrouded netherland, who constantly harangued the inmates with promises of pain and extermination. Intermittent bursts of flame shot up from jagged cracks in the ground, threatening to consume anyone in its path. Shrieks of torment could be heard piercing the murky atmosphere, further unnerving the petrified captives. Only one seemed unaffected by all the inflicted fear and turmoil. Eriel's strength and determination soon pacified the men and women with whom he was confined. When they all became more calm and subdued, he began to speak to them softly as an adult to his children. Long ago you entrusted me to protect the Book of Magica and to be faithful to its special purpose. It must seem that I have failed you and condemned us all to oblivion, but fear not! This hell is only a test of your faith and resolve. The power of Magica did not vanish in fire. On the third day I will evoke the spell of Restoration. United we shall return to Blessing and, armed with the strength of Magica, we will be triumphant. Many will perish, but Magica and our souls cannot be restored until three days have passed. Take heart my friends. Victory awaits you.
Even magic has its limitations and as Eriel explained to his flock, the spell could not be activated until a waiting period of at least three days. One third of the souls of Blessing would be melded into the Evilsyde collective before Eriel could be effective with the words of Restoration.
The old ones were the first to go. Cries of encouragement and hope were shouted to the condemned as they trudged slowly to their fate. One by one they were thrown into the assimilation chamber where a blinding blue spark gave evidence of their demise. With each burst Eriel's heavy heart ached with guilt for his part in this slaughter of his charges. If only he had not become so complacent. He above all should never have let this tragedy transpire.
In the compound holding the young adults, an insurrection of sorts was occurring. A boy of seventeen years called Challis was urging an uprising among his captured companions. Futile though it was, it earned Challis a place in the cell adjoining Eriel's. His rantings and ravings were soon quelled by Eriel's quiet urging and the two settled into serious conversation. Eriel knew his time of assimilation was near and only hoped it would not be scheduled before the three day waiting period for Restoration was ended. Shadowcast wanted to personally oversee Eriel's termination but couldn't abandon his duties on Blessing until all was secure. Would there be enough time?
Eriel realized some of his own strong qualities in Challis and decided that this was an opportunity not to be lost. He instructed Challis to remove all anger from his mind and hate from his heart. Only the pure could receive and transmit this most important of spells. Convinced that this young man was ready, he joined with his spirit and gave him these words. Sanasha Gorath Sollis Arcanna, Words that would resurrect the masses if delivered correctly and in time.
Over two days had passed before Shadowcast was ready for travel to Otherworld to deliver Eriel to his fate. His journey through Otherworld was marked by what could pass for cheers, if they weren't shouted from the mouths of utterly inhuman shapes and forms. Upon his arrival he instructed the guards to take him straight to Eriel. Once there he announced with great satisfaction that he would personally supervise Eriel's execution in a matter of hours. Nearby, Challis loudly voiced his objection to this treatment of his newly met hero and was rewarded by kicks and punches until he could no longer speak. Eriel's heart sank. Had he misjudged Challis and entrusted his people's future to a reckless youth? Eriel's mind wandered to his own younger days. He too had been restless and foolhardy, but in time had outgrown these traits and become the adored leader of Blessing. He wondered if Challis had yet experienced love. Eriel himself had turned his back on the beautiful and innocent Annica. She was his intended from birth, but he couldn't let love for this saintly child cloud his duties to Blessing and the Book.
One hour remained in the wait for Restoration. Eriel's hopes were soaring. Surely Shadowcast would fail once again. But as that thought surfaced, so did Evilsyde's dark leader. Eriel was led away with head held high, but as he passed Challis he gave just the slightest nod. A gesture that wasn't lost on the youth. Eriel was then taken to the assimilation chamber and strapped to the cross-like structure in the middle of the room. Seconds were all that stood in the way of resurrection or destruction. Shadowcast walked to Eriel, presumably to gloat one last time to his old nemesis. Eriel welcomed the time that would be wasted, but at the last moment Shadowcast seemed to reconsider and raised his arm in signal for the end to begin. The arm dropped and, with crackle and hiss, Eriel was no more. Shadowcast and his minions erupted with joy. Never again to be slaves. Now to be masters.
Challis heard the cheering and knew that Eriel had passed without time to summon the spell. Now only he could influence the future. He heard the rattling of armor and realized they were coming for him. Soon the guards appeared and dragged the struggling Challis from his confinement. One of his jailers struck him a mighty blow across the face and suddenly all his anger left him. He was sure of what he must do. Thunder starts from silence and he would be thunder.
Challis was taken to the chamber and secured to the cross. Shadowcast approached him and asked if he had any last thing to say before assimilation. Challis smiled and said he did. Then with an evil laugh, Shadowcast raised his arm and announced that his question was only a final killing joke. It was now or never. As the arm fell in signal, Challis shouted out the spell: Sanasha Gorath Sollis Arcanna and all hell actually broke loose. Challis and the good folk of Blessing were bathed in an incredible rush of light. Shadowcast and all his wicked throng writhed in agony in the darkness they were spawned from, as the fierce illumination sought them out and consumed each troll, ogre and gargoyle in a horrible melting frenzy. Shadowcast, hiding in the last black space to be found, watched the light creep irresistibly toward him. At the last moment he cloaked his body with his unpriestly robe and muttered what sounded like an oath as the light touched the cloth. The robe erupted into flame and then there was nothing. Surely Shadowcast was also consumed by fire! But that tale would not yet be told. Now as each remaining citizen of Blessing was transported instantly back to their home, they found themselves standing among thousands of recognizable stone statues. These monuments represented their fallen comrades and would ever be a lasting testament to the dangers of evil and the power of Magica.
Now came the time of mourning. Funeral pyres brightened the night sky for weeks and songs of sorrow could be heard across the land long after the flames had sputtered and died. When the prolonged periods of grieving had ended, the citizens and their council directed attention to the task of anointing a new leader and protector of the restored Book of Magica. The choice seemed a simple one. Challis had resurrected the populace and the Book, but many questioned his youth and inexperience.
The debate raged on as the time of choosing approached. The candidates were summoned to the sacred place. Eloquent speeches were made on behalf of them all. Only Challis lacked a champion and it seemed certain that he would be passed over. Will anyone speak for the boy? asked the council. The question was greeted by silence as the judges turned away to cast their votes. Then the quiet was broken. A handsome woman with golden hair, now flecked with traces of gray, spoke: Challis must be chosen. This is the secret I have carried with me for all these years. Although I was once rebuffed by my only true love, Eriel, our brief union produced the young man standing before you. Eriel was never to know that he had sired this free spirit, but he will live on through his son's achievements if you now find him worthy. So spoke Annica, mother of Challis.
The decision was now reached quickly. Annica's revelation left little doubt in the minds of the councillors that Challis should indeed succeed his father. Evilsyde had been defeated, Shadowcast was hopefully destroyed, Challis had been chosen to lead his people and, despite the huge number of casualties, the old way of life began again. But, evil does not easily die. Shadowcast did indeed survive and persist in his attempts to challenge and conquer Blessing. Great battles would be fought. Brave heroes would rise to the occasion and legends were created. There was, of course, the unforgettable War of the Darkpeace when Challis . Ah! But that's another story! 
And the games still go on
With a warning to the bishop from the pawn
No one sees an angel till it smashes to the ground
And then you run somewhere, and leave it lying thereThen on we sail
Never thinking that the wind could ever fail
No one gets to heaven till they've lived awhile in hell
And even then it's rare that you'll be going thereNow we understand
All traces of Magica must be eliminated
Infection, infection

of Blessing were bathed in an incredible rush of
light. Shadowcast and all his wicked throng writhed in
agony in the darkness they were spawned from, as the
fierce illumination sought them out and consumed each
troll, ogre and gargoyle in a horrible melting frenzy.
Shadowcast, hiding in the last black space to be
found, watched the light creep irresistibly toward
him. At the last moment he cloaked his body with his
unpriestly robe and muttered what sounded like an oath
as the light touched the cloth. The robe erupted into
flame and then there was nothing. Surely Shadowcast
was also consumed by fire! But that tale would not yet
be told. Now as each remaining citizen of Blessing was
transported instantly back to their home, they found
themselves standing among thousands of recognizable
stone statues. These monuments represented their
fallen comrades and would ever be a lasting testament
to the dangers of evil and the power of Magica.Now came the time of mourning. Funeral pyres
brightened the night sky for weeks and songs of sorrow
could be heard across the land long after the flames
had sputtered and died. When the prolonged periods of
grieving had ended, the citizens and their council
directed attention to the task of anointing a new
leader and protector of the restored Book of Magica.
The choice seemed a simple one. Challis had
resurrected the populace and the Book, but many
questioned his youth and inexperience.The debate raged on as the time of choosing approached.
The candidates were summoned to the sacred
place. Eloquent speeches were made on behalf of them
all. Only Challis lacked a champion and it seemed
certain that he would be passed over. "Will anyone
speak for the boy?" asked the council. The question
was greeted by silence as the judges turned away to
cast their votes. Then the quiet was broken. A
handsome woman with golden hair, now flecked with
traces of gray, spoke: "Challis must be chosen. This
is the secret I have carried with me for all these
years. Although I was once rebuffed by my only true
love, Eriel, our brief union produced the young man
standing before you. Eriel was never to know that he
had sired this free spirit, but he will live on
through his son's achievements if you now find him
worthy." So spoke Annica, mother of Challis.The decision was now reached quickly. Annica's
revelation left little doubt in the minds of the
councillors that Challis should indeed succeed his
father. Evilsyde had been defeated, Shadowcast was
hopefully destroyed, Challis had been chosen to lead
his people and, despite the huge number of casualties,
the old way of life began again. But, evil does not
easily die. Shadowcast did indeed survive and persist
in his attempts to challenge and conquer Blessing.
Great battles would be fought. Brave heroes would rise
to the occasion and legends were created. There was,
of course, the unforgettable War of the Darkpeace when
Challis..... Ah! But that's another story!

That a child can tell who's evil
But it's a good thing if we sing alongCold day we can make a fire
Burn another liar
Can witches ever die hey let's burnOne more for the road gimme the same again
One more for the roadWell I've never been here before
And the room is really empty
But there's a big line waiting for the show
Nice day for an execution
Another wrong conclusion
But someone's got to pay so let's burnOne more for the road same again
One more for the roadThere's a child who just sees evil
And a man who just loves pain
But I've heard that we can't save them
So gimme me the same againThere's a cross that you can't carry
Cause it's heavier than hell
And if you should meet your maker
Just pray that he won't yell
One more for the roadOne more for the road

Oh, Johnny was a dark child
He was promised to us all
But rides in the night,
But can lift you out of sight when they call, that's allMy Sally was a princess
And she was chosen for the crown
But chains can't stop the soundOf one night in the city
One night looking prettyThen someone opened doorways
And Johnny slipped away
Running for the bright,
Where dark is always light
But there's no day, no wayThe princess saw the dark child
And the dark child said her nameCome steal away, we'll play the gameDo you watch, do you see
Do you know the people in me
I'm the bite, I'm the bark, I'm the scream
I'm you poor, I'm you sure
I'm you holy, I'm you pure
I can tell you tales you just might not believeOne night in the city, one night looking pretty
One night in the city, one night looking pretty(One night)The children shared the wonder
Of the leather and the lace
But one child went away,
And one child stayed to playFor one night in the city
One night looking pretty yeahOne night in the city
One night looking pretty yeahBut chains don't make the wall
And dreams lay where they fall
Darkness in the night when dreams make up the light
One night in the city, one night looking pretty yeah
One night in the city, feeling pretty, pretty in the city
One night in the city
One night, one night, one night, one night
One night in the city
One night, one night
One child went away and one child stayed to play
Chains don't make the wall, dreams are lay just where they fall
In the city, one night in the city 
Seems like heard this song a thousand times before
He just wanted her but she wants more
So build a wall
Keep it all to herself, ohAlways never seemed to be too much
Reaching out became a spider's touch
Wrapped in chains
Sad remains
Another victim ofOver love
Over loveHe was just the devil in a thing disguise
Jealousy behind the greenest eyes
Turn the page
Close the cage
On another victim ofOver love
Over love, yeah

Baby never knew when she was grown
Now mamma's gone
And come the dawn
You got another victim ofOver love

Give me a choice between pleasure and pain
I choose painAnother day without a heartbeat
How can your heart beat
If they've taken it away
For the first time, just don't think about it
Take the water and wash your face with painYou can take away the power
Your finest hour
It's when you laugh in their faces
For the first time just forget about it
Take a hammer and pound yourself with painBury my bones on the moon
If they never should find me it would be too soon
Give me a choice between power and pain
I choose pain 
Ik heb het nooit begrepen
Yo, waarom mijn vader verdween
Nu ben ik fucked up
Nu sta ik alleen
Maak me zorgen om mijn moeder
Maar als je man genoeg bent om kinderen te maken
Wees dan ook dezelfde man om ze op te voeden
Ja, maar ik had nooit een vaderfiguur
Was altijd rollen met de boys
Je hoort het laat in de buurt
Maar als ik thuis kwam
Zag mijn moeder mij niet
Dagdienst en nachtdienst
Zodat ik en mijn brotha konden lopen op die nikies
Ja, ik zag de tranen in haar ogen
Ze wou me alles geven maar een vader had ik nodig
Een vader die me lief had
Eentje waarmee ik praten kon
Een vader die een fucking man van me maken konIk probeer het te begrijpen maar kijk
Had je ruzie met mijn moeder kon je blijven van mij
Ik ben je zoon gozer
En ik zal het blijven gozer, altijd
Maar een vreemde zal je blijven voor mij, yeahMaar soms denk ik dat ik lauw word
Soms denk ik dat alles mis gaat
Dat ik net zoals jou word
Ik weet niet eens waar je bent
Ze zeggen dat ik op je lijk
Maar ik weet niet eens wie je bentSoms denk ik dat ik lauw wordt
Soms denk ik dat alles mis gaat
Dat ik net zoals jou wordt
Ik weet niet eens waar je bent
Ze zeggen dat ik op je lijk
Maar ik weet niet eens wie je bentGozer, je moest eens weten hoe het zat
Vroeger in de klas
Ik wist nooit wat te zeggen als ze vroegen waar je was, ah
Niet te omschrijven de gevoelens die ik had
Maar ik had het nooit gesnapt wat mijn moeder in je zagWat is een vader
Jongen, kan je bouwen op hem
Kan je, kan je blindelings vertrouwen op hem
Zeg me
Ey, ze denken dat ik haat voor hem had
Maar hoe kun je iemand haten die je nauwelijks kentVolgens mijn ma ben je een junk en zit je in de gevangenis
Mijn moeder die moet keihard werken omdat er niet anders is
En die stiefvaders die hoef ik niet zien
Omdat er voor je echte vader simpelweg geen vervanging isJe belde maar je wilde praten
Ik zeg sodemieter op
Wat denk je wel niet na al die fucking jaren
Nu kom je doen alsof er niks was
Maar als je denkt dat ik alles vergeten ben
Ja, dan heb je het mis gastMaar soms denk ik dat ik lauw word
Soms denk ik dat alles mis gaat
Dat ik net zoals jou word
Ik weet niet eens waar je bent
Ze zeggen dat ik op je lijk
Maar ik weet niet eens wie je bentSoms denk ik dat ik lauw wordt
Soms denk ik dat alles mis gaat
Dat ik net zoals jou wordt
Ik weet niet eens waar je bent
Ze zeggen dat ik op je lijk
Maar ik weet niet eens wie je bentAl die jaren verloren
Al die jaren zijn weg
En al die jaren dat wij konden chillen heb je verpest
Jongen, hoe gaat het met je?
Jongen, ben je oke?
Ey jongen, waar is je vader?
Waarom ben je alleen?
En waarom lijkt het alsof er echt niemand meer om me geef?
Waarom wanneer ik verdriet heb is er niemand om me heen?
Ik ben alleen geboren
Voel alleen de pijn
Maar weet dat ik niet leef om fucking alleen te zijnYeah, je liet ons in de steek
En net toen we je nodig hadden
Gozer, was je niet meer om ons heen
Ja, ik weet niet of je het weet
Maar fuck it gozer,
Na een jaar of 2 was je niet meer een probleem
Ja, en daarom ben ik solo
En ja ik weet niet alles
Je moet me niet vragen waarom het zo loop
Ze zeggen zo vader, zo zoon
Maar n ding weet ik van mezelf, jongen
Later wordt ik nooit zoMaar soms denk ik dat ik lauw word
Soms denk ik dat alles mis gaat
Dat ik net zoals jou word
Ik weet niet eens waar je bent
Ze zeggen dat ik op je lijk
Maar ik weet niet eens wie je bentSoms denk ik dat ik lauw wordt
Soms denk ik dat alles mis gaat
Dat ik net zoals jou wordt
Ik weet niet eens waar je bent
Ze zeggen dat ik op je lijk
Maar ik weet niet eens wie je bentEn nu kom je me bellen
Vanuit de gevangenis
Kom je nu verhalen vertellen
Maar het doet me helemaal niks
Het is nu een beetje te laat om een vader te hebben
Ik weet niet eens of jij een zoon verdiend
Maar ooit misschien
En ik weet niet of ik op je lijk papaWant ik heb je nooit gezien

Get out of my way and push
You can turn the wheel

Break the body down
Oh push
Out of my way I'll push
You better pushYou gotta push
Hands against the wall

You've made it through another day
Driving past the back roads of your mind
You could have turned the other way
And break down on the sanity you've found inside youSomeone said that you are fantasy
But in the darkness
Behind your smile
You scream
Scream
Scream for the crazy ones
Scream at the things you've done
Scream at the rising sunWe bless the beautiful
Let us forgive you for your sins
These must be holy ones
How could we believe they'd let us inOh, once I heard that they were fantasy
But in the darkness
Behind their smiles
They scream
Scream
Scream of a broken heart
Scream as they come apart
Scream cause they never started
ScreamNo pain
No sympathy
You've always been so steady at the wheelSome friend reality
You break down on the highway
About to see it my wayScream at the crazy ones
Scream cause they all have sons
Scream as they point the gun at youScream at the bleeding heart
Scream cause the end won't start
Scream as you come apart again
Again, again, again 
Shame on the night
For places I've been
And what I've seen
For giving me the strangest dreams
But you never really know just what they mean
Oh so shame on the night
Oh rightAnd shame on you
You've stolen the day
Snatched it away
But I saw the sky
An I never want to die
Now you know the reason why
I said, oh shame on the nightYou don't care what you've done
So I think I'd better runShame on the sun
For the light you sold
I've lost my hold
On the magic flame
And now I know your name
Oh Lord just go the way you came again
Oh shame on the nightYou don't care what you've done
So I know I'd better runShame on the night
For places I've been
And what I've seen
Forgive me the strangest dreams
You never, never, never, never know just what they mean
And oh shame on the nightYou don't care what you've done
Here I go I've got to run 
Fingers scratching blackboards
Make cowards of the brave
A natural reaction
From the cradle to the graveRats and bats and spiders
And little things that crawl
Never make me tremble
I'm bothered not at allThen I saw you
Something new inside of me
What's this shakin'
You made me shiverCemetery midnights
Walking on the dead
Never seemed to matter
It's all inside your headNames are only letters
Mentioned on a stone
And If you're going somewhere
You're going it aloneThen I saw you
Something new inside of me
What's this shakin'
You made me shiverMagic charms and voodoo
And all those other spells
Didn't make impressions
I never slept so wellIf I had a nightmare
I'm sure that I would know
I really don't remember

If I could sleep at night
Then somehow I'd see
Why everything's wrong
Or maybe it's just me
Does anybody know this place that I'm in
Why I might be alone
Imagination is a terrible thing
What if I'm wrong
But here's what I've been thinking
It must be the end of the worldWhat ever happened to the rock and roll song
Breaking your brain
Making you stronger
They say you never hear the bullet that kills
And I don't hear a soundIt's not about a change or revolution
What's gone today is still called substitutionDon't get emotional but we're out of time
The melody's gone
And fools have got the sunshine
If I'm mistaken and I see you again
Don't leave me alone
Maybe tomorrow
Could be the end of the world 
Oh no - they're at it again
Looking inside my secrets
Coming through cracks before I mend the wallGet out - cause you're breaking the law
How did you ever find me
Places where I can hide can't get much smallerI have invisible dreams
Where no one can touch me
Maybe I'll find a way to disappearNo one moves - and no one dies
Just the eyesI've run as fast as I can
Thinking they'll never catch me
What a waste of breath a waste of timeFeel like digging a hole
Going in even deeper
Maybe they just can't see what just can't shineI'll be lost - so no goddbyes
If no one moves then nothing dies
Just the eyesOh no - they've done it again
Sending out the detectives
Searching for signs of life and that means meIn my invisible dreams
When no one is watching
I'd make the whole world blind and I'd be freeI'll be lost - so no replies
If no one looks then no one dies
Just the eyes
Those eyesMagic numbers
Even sacrifice
I can't find a way
Cause nothing stops the eyes 
He's the king of rock and rollHot night summer in the city
Just above the smoking burn
Look out he's evil but he's pretty
And always gonna twist and turnHe's got the midnight madness
He's got control
He's the king of rock and rollBad blood and everybody knows it
But everybody doesn't care
He's got the only way to show it
They want to see it everywhereHe's got to give you fever
He'll scratch your soul
He's the king of rock and roll
The king of rock and rollBad boy always on the cover
Gettin' the story told
Fast fast one way or another
'Cause you never never never never never got oldHe makes a special magic
You got control
You are the king of rock and rollHe's got the midnight madness
He's got a soul
'Cause he's the king of rock and roll
King of rock and roll
Rock and roll
Rock and roll
Rock and roll
Rock and roll
The king of rock and roll
Yeah! 
Bless me father I must go away
To save us from the one's who don't believe
Confess me father I have sin but maybe
Angels really sing
Fot the man who would be kingWe laugh at your religion
You people of the sand
We have no superstition
You can read it in our handsForgive me father for the change we bring
But it's all for the man who would be kingDon't leave a body standing
Not the holy not the small
Deliver us from evil
If it's yours we want it allLately father I've been wondering
Is the devil just the man who would be kingHow can right be ever wrong
We are glory we are stronger than youWe never got an answer
But it's just too late to ask
The bloody flag was waving
And our hearts just ran too fastCurse me father for the chains we bring
And don't believe the man who would be kingWe never got an answer
Cause the question slipped my mind
I've been so busy killing
That I haven't found the right time 
Close the city and tell the people that something's coming to call
Death and darkness are rushing forward to take a bite from the wall, ohYou've nothing to say
They're breaking away
If you listen to fools
The Mob Rules
The Mob RulesKill the spirit and you'll be blinded, the end is always the same
Play with fire, you burn your fingers and lose your hold of the flame, ohIt's over, it's done
The end is begun
If you listen to fools
The Mob RulesYou've nothing to say
Oh, they're breaking away
If you listen to foolsBreak the circle and stop the movement, the wheel is thrown to the ground
Just remember it might start rolling and take you right back aroundYou're all fools!
The Mob Rules! 
If there isn't light when no one sees
Then how can I know what you might believe?
A story told that can't be real
Somehow must reflect the truth we feel, yeahFade away, fade away
Vanish into small
Fade away, fade away
Break the crystal ball oh!It's the sign
Feels like the time!On a small world, west of wonder
Somewhere, nowhere all
There's a rainbow that will shimmer
When the summer falls
If an echo darts in dancer
When it hears a certain song
Then the beast is free to wander
But never is seen aroundAnd it's the sign of the southern cross
It's the sign of the southern cross
All right
Sail away
To the sign
OhFrom the book, the word is spoken
Whispers from forgotten psalms
Gather all around the young ones
They will make us strong
Reach above your dreams of pleasure
Given life to those who died
Look beyond your own horizons
Sail the ship of signsAnd it's the sign of the southern cross
It's the sign of the southern cross
Fade away, fade away
Break the crystal ball
Fade away, fade away
I can't accept it anymoreOn a real world, west of wonder
Somewhere, nowhere all
There's a rainbow, see it shimmer
When the summer falls
From the book, the word is spoken
Whispers from forgotten psalms
Gather all around the young ones
They will make us strong!It's the sign of the southern cross
It's the sign of the southern crossDon't live for pleasure
Make life your treasure
Fade away!
Eight miles high, about to fall
And no one there to catch you
Look for the sign, the time
The sign of the southern cross, yeah 
Who cares what came before
We were only starlight
One day, then nevermore
Because we're whispers in the windOnce upon a time
The world was never blind
Like we areRight now it seems
You're only dreams and shadows
If wishes could be eagles how you'd flyThis is your life
This is your time
What if the flame won't last forever
This is your here
This is your now
Let it be magicalWho cares what came before
We're only starlightOnce upon the time
All the world was blind
Like we areThis is your life
This is your time
Look at your world
This is your life 
Someone told me I would never be free
The way you are is way you'll always be
But it's all wrong
There's time to burnHurt is on the pleasure wheel
But you can't hurt if you can't feel
And you can feel you've got something to learn
You've got time to burnYou were lost inside a pounding heart
Waiting for the game to start
But you won't play you've so much to learn
Like you never say never
We'll live forever
And you've got time to burnWhen the wolf is loose in the city
The the city will fight to survive
You can hide in the streets of the city
But no one will care
No one will know you're alive
There's time to burn

And you can feel - you've got something to learn
You've got Time To Burn
You were lost inside a pounding heart
Waiting for the game to start
But you won't play - you've so much to learn

Welcome to sun down, welcome to the dark
Could it be that evil has heroesBring everybody down, celebration
Passing of the light
Giving up your spirit to the nightYou'll turn to stone, turn to stone
Just for ever
You'll turn to stone, turn to stoneHere comes a fire
We'll burn it to the ground
Inside the page lies the powerWe've turned it all around, celebration
Words have control
To take away your heart and then your soulYou'll turn to stone, turn to stone
Just for ever
You'll turn to stone, turn to stoneOh pray for a miracle
But the wishes in the well have all gone dry
There's no way for a miracle
It's not the way you live, it's how you'll dieWelcome to sun down, welcome to the dark
Could it be that the evil has heroesWe've turned it all around, celebration
Words have control
To take away your heart and then your soulYou'll turn to stone, turn to stone
Just for ever
You'll turn to stone
You'll turn to stone, turn to stoneConcerning the inhabitants of otherworld.
There are many similarities to be found, parallel to our own society.
The individual must be absorbed. The collective must be as one. Feed my head! 
A rumble of thunder, I'm suddenly under your spell
No rhyme or reason, or time of the season, but oh well
The darkened deliver, I shake and I shiver down your soul
You know what to cover, I think for another it's a story told
So get a good hold, yeahRegiment fooled you, you thought that you knew who you are
A simple equation, that's the relation, but that's gone too far
A time of suspicion, a special condition that we all know
So let it all go!Turn up the night!
Turn up the night!
Turn up the night, it feels so right!Night time sorrow, taken like a pain
Black will not become a white, it's all the same
Evil lurks in twilight, dances in the dark
Makes you need the movement, like a fire needs a spark to burn!A rumble of thunder, I'm suddenly under your spell
No rhyme or reason, or time of the season, but oh well
The darkened deliver, I shake and I shiver down your soul
So get a good hold, yeahTurn up the night!
Turn up the night!
Turn up the night, it feels so right!
Turn up the night!
Turn up the night!
If it feels right
Turn off the light!
Turn up the night!

Till he was shot down from the sky
You can't walk on water, don't try

He was ready to rock and roll
So ready to lose control
But when a hungry heart
Gets a taste of freedom you better look outHe was ready to push and shove
Ready to fight for love
But I've seen it before
And it can make you crazy
The eyes are what you seeWhy are they watching meShe was ready to black and white
The colors were just too bright
She loved to fly
But she hated fallingShe was caught in the in-between
Her dirty would not come clean
She ran for light
But she just got darknessJust when you think you're free
The eyes are what you seeWhy are they watching me
Why do they do the things they do
Why are they watching me
Watching youIf only the eyes could see
Then you'd know your destiny
The mind is an enemy
And you just need a friendAre you ready for rock and roll
Ready to take control
If you see the eyes
Will it make you crazy crazy
Crazy 
You say you've never seen the light before
Does anyone believe you
Don't let them hear you say anymore
Nothing's really safe around hereWe are an imitation of the crown
We never turn the pages
They cannot let your spirit touch the ground
And nothing's gonna change around here, noCrack in the ceiling
Hole in the wall
They bend you over
But you won't crawl awayYou've got two in the bushes
One in the hand
They'd make you over
But they can't understand you
You're always gonna be the wild onePretend that all you really feel is pain
Just hide behind some sorrow
How sad
But you'd do it all again
(I guess that) Nobody changes 'round hereCat in the cradle
Man in the moon
They'd make you over
But it's too soon to know, noSmoke in the kitchen
Fire in the hall
The train is coming
And you can hear it calling
You're always gonna be the wild oneCrack in the ceiling

They bend you over
But you won't crawl awayYou've got two in the bushes
One in the hand
They'd make you over
But they can't understand you
You're always gonna be the Wild One

'Cause it's free and I see that it's me
Who's lost and never found
I cry out for magic, I feel it dancing in the light
It was cold, I lost my hold
To the shadows of the nightNo sign of the morning coming
You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow in the dark
A rainbow in the darkDo your demons, do they ever let you go?
When you've tried, do they hide, deep inside
Is it someone that you know
You're just a picture, your're an image caught in time
We're a lie, you and I
We're words without a rhymeThere's no sign of the morning coming
You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow in the dark
Just a rainbow in the dark, yeahWhen I see lightning, you know it always brings me down
'Cause it's free and I see that it's me
Who's lost and never found
Feel the magic, I feel it floating in the air
But it's fear, and you'll hear
It calling you bewareLook out

There's perfect harmony
In the rising and the falling of the sea
And as we sail along
I never fail to be astounded by the things we'll do for promises
And a songWe are the innocent
We are the damned
We were caught in the middle of the madness
Hunted by the lion and the lamb oh, ohWe bring you fantasy
We bring you pain
It's your one great chance for a miracle
Or we will disappear
Never to be seen againAnd all the fools sailed away
All the fools sailed away
Sailed awayWe bring you beautiful
We teach you sin
We can give you a piece of the universe
Or we will disappear
Never to return againAnd all the fools sailed away
All the fools sailed away

Sailed awayAnd as we drift along
I never fail to be astounded by the things we'll do for promises
And a songWe are the innocent
We cut we bleed
We're your one great chance for a miracle
And a miracle is something you needThey'll take your diamonds
And then give you steel
You'll be caught in the middle of the madness
Just lost like them
And part of all the pain that they feel, yeahAnd all the fools sailed away
All the fools sailed away
All the fools sailed away
Leaving nothing, nothing more to say
All the fools sailed awayThey say you're beautiful
And they'll always let you in
But doors are never open
To the child without a trace of sinSail away 
Looking inside of yourself
You might see someone you don't know
Maybe it's just what you need
Letting the river in you flowYou can sail away to the sun
And let it burn you while you can
Or walk a long bloody road
Like the hero who never ranYou'll feel it
You'll feel it
You'll feel the rush of it allFlying away int the clouds
You know you're loosing your control
And finding you way in the dark
Like some poor forgotten soulYou'll feel it
You'll see it
You'll feel the rush of the city lights
You'll feel it
I see it in your eyes, you'reCaught in the middle
Just like the way you've always been
Caught in the middle
Helpless againLooking inside of yourself
You might see someone you don't know
Maybe it's just what you need
Letting the river I know that's in you flowYou can feel it
You can see it
You know the rush of thunder, yeah
You'll feel it
I see it in your eyes, you'reCaught in the middle
Just like the way you've always been
Caught in the middle
Helpless again
Like the rush of a thunder
That brings you under
There's some kind of spark
You're caught right there in the middle
You're caught in the middle
Caught in the middle again
All night long yeah hmm hmm hmm
You break it off in the middle 
Hey the old ones speak of winter, the young ones praise the sun
And time just slips away
Oh running into nowhere turning like a wheel
And a year becomes a dayWhenever we dream that's when we fly
So here is a dream for just you and IWe'll find the sacred heart, somewhere bleeding in the night, yeah
Look for the light and find the sacred heartOh here we see the wizard staring through the glass
And he's pointing right at you
Now you can see tomorrow the answer and the lie
And the things you've got to do, yeahOh, sometimes you never fall, and ah, you're the lucky one
But oh, sometimes you want it all you've got to reach for the sunAnd find the sacred heart, somewhere bleeding in the night
Oh look to the lightYou fight to kill the dragon you bargain with the beast
Then you sail into a sight
You run along the rainbow and never leave the ground
Still you don't know whyWhenever you dream you're holding the key
I opens the door to let you be freeAnd find the sacred heart, somewhere bleeding in the night
Run for the light and you'll find the sacred heartA shout comes from the wizard the sky begins to crack
And he's looking right at you, quick
Run along the rainbow before it turns to black, attackAnd oh, sometimes you never fall, and ah, you're the lucky one
Oh, sometimes you need it all you've got to reach for the sunAnd find the sacred heart yeah, somewhere bleeding in the night
Find the sacred heart 
If your circle stays unbroken
Then you're a lucky man
'Cause it never, never, never has for meIn the palace of the virgin
Lies the chalice of the soul
And it's likely you might find the answer thereShe had thirteen years of teenage tears
And never a helping hand
She had fourteen more of rain before
She saw the sight of land
She was a photograph just ripped in half
A smile inside a frown
And the the light, the answer right
Inside her coming downIt said
I can go away
I can leave here
I can be invisible
I go awayHe was just eighteen and in-between
A lady and a man
His daddy's girl in momma's world
That was when he ran
You know the word confused has been abused
But that's just what he was
And then the spark inside the dark
The answer came because it saidYou can go away
You can leave here
You can be invisibleWell I grew up quick and I felt the kick
Of life upon a stage
So I bought the book and took a fast look
At just the very last page
It was a single word that I'd just heard
From the two that came before
The only way to really stay
Is to walk right out the doorSo you can go away
I'm gonna leave here
I can be invisibleAnd go away again
I can go away
When I leave here
I can be invisibleI said, when you can go away
Lord you know it's right to leave here
So I just become invisible
I went away
I disappeared before your eyes
You never touch me you never feel me
You'll never see me again
Because I've just become unseen
Well I'm a photograph that's been torn in half
We're all eighteen and we're in between
We need a helping hand to the holy land
To be invisible
To go away 
Oh no - they're at it again
Looking inside my secrets
Coming through cracks before I mend the wallGet out - cause you're breaking the law
How did you ever find me
Places where I can hide can't get much smallerI have invisible dreams
Where no one can touch me
Maybe I'll find a way to disappearNo one moves - and no one dies
Just the eyesI've run as fast as I can
Thinking they'll never catch me
What a waste of breath a waste of timeFeel like digging a hole
Going in even deeper
Maybe they just can't see what just can't shineI'll be lost - so no goddbyes
If no one moves then nothing dies
Just the eyesOh no - they've done it again
Sending out the detectives
Searching for signs of life and that means meIn my invisible dreams
When no one is watching
I'd make the whole world blind and I'd be freeI'll be lost - so no replies
If no one looks then no one dies
Just the eyes
Those eyesMagic numbers
Even sacrifice
I can't find a way
Cause nothing stops the eyes 
Someone said
You'll light up the universe
It's there in your head then
Crazy comes to callBreak me down
I'm only an everyone
Running from free
Running from meAnd though it's not of my choosing

And the chains are on, see them flying through the sky
They we're frightening in the darkness (yes chains are on)
They had rainbows in their eyes (the chains are on)

It has been a thousand years since the once powerful
planet of Blessing lost its life-giving two suns, and
countless millennia since the days of the great
magicians. An expedition of alien voyagers came upon
the now ice-covered sphere, drawn there by an
unexplained lone beacon far below the miles of frozen
moisture, they unlocked a written history of Blessing
from its almost undiscovered tomb. So begins the story
of Magica.It was a time of celebration. The Book of Magica and
the wizards who had used its spells so wisely for the
good of the people were being honored in all the great
cities of the world. There was however an exception.
Where good thrives, evil survives and evil has plans
for survival.The celebration of thanks and prosperity would signal
the forces of Evilsyde to begin the attack and
ultimate capture and destruction of Magica. The spells
from the Book would be used to turn all of those
unwilling to join Evilsyde into statues of stone and
send their spirits to Otherworld, where they would
eventually be assimilated into the energy needed to
drive Evilsyde, and maintain its power without the
necessity of the Book and its incantations forever.Defenses were naturally relaxed during the festive
preparations and although the battle was well-fought
by both factions, the minions of the dark prevailed.
Their assault was well-planned and executed to a
fault. After overwhelming their initial opposition,
they pushed on to the sacred ground upon which the
Book of Magica rested. They possessed a much weaker
form of magic themselves, and although it would be
normally quite useless against the strength of Magica,
the inability of the Wizards to gather themselves
together in time, coupled with the perfect timing and
determination of the attackers, spelled doom for the
Book and its followers.The leader of the insurrection was the high priest and
executioner known as Shadowcast. His presence could
make the naughtiest of children become obedient and
inspire great fear among the adult population. This
man, most vile, would now be ruler of all and
answerable to none. His reign would plunge Blessing
into eternal darkness and prepare the way for the
coming of his master, Astoroth, the Grand Duke of Hell.The capture of Magica did not, however, mean that
Shadowcast had finally reached his goal. He must now
find and conquer Blessing's Grand Wizard and legendary
hero, Eriel. Eriel, who defeated Evilsyde time and
again with his understanding and use of Magica's
spells. He would be the last stumbling block of total
domination.Eriel had removed himself from the general population
in anticipation of everlasting peace and now he
devoted all of his energy to meditation and praise of
his God. Lately though, he had been visited by many
temptations in his dreams. Promises of pleasure,
riches and power raced through his sleeping mind. All
these lures had been placed there by Shadowcast,
hoping to avoid confrontation between this dominant
man and his own villainous forces. Eriel however had
resisted these solicitations and was now warned of
some impending danger. He managed to make his way to
the sacred ground by cloaking his identity with simple
spells, only to be discovered just before his attempt
to rescue the Book of Magica, but not before he was
able to memorize the most important of Magica's
charms, The spell of Restoration.The ceremony of thanksgiving was now directed toward
the transmission of spirits to Otherworld. One by one
the good souls of Blessing were turned to stone and
sent on to their grisly fate, until only the noble
Eriel remained. The spectacle that followed was meant
to degrade Eriel and raise the courage of the cowardly
supplicants of Evilsyde, but true to his
indominantable bearing, he promised to return and
banish Evilsyde forever. Then he was gone.The horrors of Otherworld are now revealed to the
masses huddled together for some small measure of
comfort. First the adults were separated from their
children amid cries and pleas for help. Next the old
ones were taken away and assigned to a place very near
the assimilation site. They were guarded by monstrous,
misshapen denizens of this shrouded netherland, who
constantly harangued the inmates with promises of pain
and extermination. Intermittent bursts of flame shot
up from jagged cracks in the ground, threatening to
consume anyone in its path. Shrieks of torment could
be heard piercing the murky atmosphere, further
unnerving the petrified captives. Only one seemed
unaffected by all the inflicted fear and turmoil.Eriel's strength and determination soon pacified the
men and women with whom he was confined. When they all
became more calm and subdued, he began to speak to
them softly as an adult to his children. "Long ago you
entrusted me to protect the Book of Magica and to be
faithful to its special purpose. It must seem that I
have failed you and condemned us all to oblivion, but
fear not! This hell is only a test of your faith and
resolve. The power of Magica did not vanish in fire.
On the third day I will evoke the spell of
Restoration. United we shall return to Blessing and,
armed with the strength of Magica, we will be
triumphant. Many will perish, but Magica and our souls
cannot be restored until three days have passed. Take
heart my friends. Victory awaits you."Even magic has its limitations and as Eriel explained
to his flock, the spell could not be activated until a
waiting period of at least three days. One third of
the souls of Blessing would be melded into the
Evilsyde collective before Eriel could be effective
with the words of Restoration.The old ones were the first to go. Cries of
encouragement and hope were shouted to the condemned
as they trudged slowly to their fate. One by one they
were thrown into the assimilation chamber where a
blinding blue spark gave evidence of their demise.
With each burst Eriel's heavy heart ached with guilt
for his part in this slaughter of his charges. If only
he had not become so complacent. He above
all should never have let this tragedy transpire.In the compound holding the young adults, an
insurrection of sorts was occurring. A boy of
seventeen years called Challis was urging an uprising
among his captured companions. Futile though it was,
it earned Challis a place in the cell adjoining
Eriel's. His rantings and ravings were soon quelled by
Eriel's quiet urging and the two settled into serious
conversation. Eriel knew his time of assimilation was
near and only hoped it would not be scheduled before
the three day waiting period for Restoration was
ended. Shadowcast wanted to personally oversee Eriel's
termination but couldn't abandon his duties on Blessing
until all was secure.Would there be enough time?Eriel realized some of his own strong qualities in
Challis and decided that this was an opportunity not
to be lost. He instructed Challis to remove all anger
from his mind and hate from his heart. Only the pure
could receive and transmit this most important of
spells. Convinced that this young man was ready, he
joined with his spirit and gave him these words.
"Sanasha Gorath Sollis Arcanna," Words that would
resurrect the masses if delivered correctly and in time.Over two days had passed before Shadowcast was ready
for travel to Otherworld to deliver Eriel to his fate.
His journey through Otherworld was marked by what
could pass for cheers, if they weren't shouted from
the mouths of utterly inhuman shapes and forms. Upon
his arrival he instructed the guards to take him
straight to Eriel. Once there he announced with great
satisfaction that he would personally supervise
Eriel's execution in a matter of hours. Nearby,
Challis loudly voiced his objection to this treatment
of his newly met hero and was rewarded by kicks and
punches until he could no longer speak. Eriel's heart
sank. Had he misjudged Challis and entrusted his
people's future to a reckless youth? Eriel's mind
wandered to his own younger days. He too had been
restless and foolhardy, but in time had outgrown these
traits and become the adored leader of Blessing. He
wondered if Challis had yet experienced love. Eriel
himself had turned his back on the beautiful and
innocent Annica. She was his intended from birth, but
he couldn't let love for this saintly child cloud his
duties to Blessing and the Book.One hour remained in the wait for Restoration. Eriel's
hopes were soaring. Surely Shadowcast would fail once
again. But as that thought surfaced, so did Evilsyde's
dark leader. Eriel was led away with head held high,
but as he passed Challis he gave just the slightest
nod. A gesture that wasn't lost on the youth. Eriel
was then taken to the assimilation chamber and
strapped to the cross-like structure in the middle of
the room. Seconds were all that stood in the way of
resurrection or destruction. Shadowcast walked to
Eriel, presumably to gloat one last time to his old
nemesis. Eriel welcomed the time that would be wasted,
but at the last moment Shadowcast seemed to reconsider
and raised his arm in signal for the end to begin. The
arm dropped and, with crackle and hiss, Eriel was no
more. Shadowcast and his minions erupted with joy.
Never again to be slaves. Now to be masters.Challis heard the cheering and knew that Eriel had
passed without time to summon the spell. Now only he
could influence the future. He heard the rattling of
armor and realized they were coming for him. Soon the
guards appeared and dragged the struggling Challis
from his confinement. One of his jailers struck him a
mighty blow across the face and suddenly all his anger
left him. He was sure of what he must do. Thunder
starts from silence and he would be thunder.Challis was taken to the chamber and secured to the
cross. Shadowcast approached him and asked if he had
any last thing to say before assimilation. Challis
smiled and said he did. Then with an evil laugh,
Shadowcast raised his arm and announced that his
question was only a final killing joke. It was now or
never. As the arm fell in signal, Challis shouted out
the spell: "Sanasha Gorath Sollis Arcanna" and all
hell actually broke loose. Challis and the good folk
of Blessing were bathed in an incredible rush of
light. Shadowcast and all his wicked throng writhed in
agony in the darkness they were spawned from, as the
fierce illumination sought them out and consumed each
troll, ogre and gargoyle in a horrible melting frenzy.
Shadowcast, hiding in the last black space to be
found, watched the light creep irresistibly toward
him. At the last moment he cloaked his body with his
unpriestly robe and muttered what sounded like an oath
as the light touched the cloth. The robe erupted into
flame and then there was nothing. Surely Shadowcast
was also consumed by fire! But that tale would not yet
be told. Now as each remaining citizen of Blessing was
transported instantly back to their home, they found
themselves standing among thousands of recognizable
stone statues. These monuments represented their
fallen comrades and would ever be a lasting testament
to the dangers of evil and the power of Magica.Now came the time of mourning. Funeral pyres
brightened the night sky for weeks and songs of sorrow
could be heard across the land long after the flames
had sputtered and died. When the prolonged periods of
grieving had ended, the citizens and their council
directed attention to the task of anointing a new
leader and protector of the restored Book of Magica.
The choice seemed a simple one. Challis had
resurrected the populace and the Book, but many
questioned his youth and inexperience.The debate raged on as the time of choosing approached.
The candidates were summoned to the sacred
place. Eloquent speeches were made on behalf of them
all. Only Challis lacked a champion and it seemed
certain that he would be passed over. "Will anyone
speak for the boy?" asked the council. The question
was greeted by silence as the judges turned away to
cast their votes. Then the quiet was broken. A
handsome woman with golden hair, now flecked with
traces of gray, spoke: "Challis must be chosen. This
is the secret I have carried with me for all these
years. Although I was once rebuffed by my only true
love, Eriel, our brief union produced the young man
standing before you. Eriel was never to know that he
had sired this free spirit, but he will live on
through his son's achievements if you now find him
worthy." So spoke Annica, mother of Challis.The decision was now reached quickly. Annica's
revelation left little doubt in the minds of the
councillors that Challis should indeed succeed his
father. Evilsyde had been defeated, Shadowcast was
hopefully destroyed, Challis had been chosen to lead
his people and, despite the huge number of casualties,
the old way of life began again. But, evil does not
easily die. Shadowcast did indeed survive and persist
in his attempts to challenge and conquer Blessing.
Great battles would be fought. Brave heroes would rise
to the occasion and legends were created. There was,
of course, the unforgettable War of the Darkpeace when
Challis..... Ah! But that's another story! 
Sing me a song, you're a singer
Do me a wrong, you're a bringer of evil
The devil is never a maker
The less that you give, you're a taker
So it's on and on and on, it's heaven and hell
Oh wellThe lover of life's not a sinner
The ending is just a beginner
The closer you get to the meaning
The sooner you'll know that you're dreaming
So it's on and on and on, oh it's on and on and on
It goes on and on and on, Heaven and Hell
I can tell
Fool, foolOh uh
Yeah, yeah, yeahWell if it seems to be real, it's illusion
For every moment of truth, there's confusion in life
Love can be seen as the answer, but nobody bleeds for the dancer
And it's on and on, on and on and on and on and on and on and onThey say that life's a carousel
Spinning fast, you've got to ride it well
The world is full of kings and queens
Who blind your eyes and steal your dreams
It's heaven and hell, oh wellAnd they'll tell you black is really white
The moon is just the sun at night
And when you walk in golden halls
You get to keep the gold that falls
It's heaven and hell, oh noFool, fool
You've got to bleed for the dancer
Fool, fool
Look for the answer
Fool, fool, fool 
A rumble of thunder, I'm suddenly under your spell
No rhyme or reason, or time of the season, but oh well
The darkened deliver, I shake and I shiver down your soul
You know what to cover, I think for another it's a story told
So get a good hold, yeahRegiment fooled you, you thought that you knew who you are
A simple equation, that's the relation, but that's gone too far
A time of suspicion, a special condition that we all know
So let it all go!Turn up the night!
Turn up the night!
Turn up the night, it feels so right!Night time sorrow, taken like a pain
Black will not become a white, it's all the same
Evil lurks in twilight, dances in the dark
Makes you need the movement, like a fire needs a spark to burn!A rumble of thunder, I'm suddenly under your spell
No rhyme or reason, or time of the season, but oh well
The darkened deliver, I shake and I shiver down your soul
So get a good hold, yeahTurn up the night!
Turn up the night!
Turn up the night, it feels so right!
Turn up the night!
Turn up the night!
If it feels right
Turn off the light!
Turn up the night! 
Someone told me I would never be free
The way you are is way you'll always be
But it's all wrong
There's time to burnHurt is on the pleasure wheel
But you can't hurt if you can't feel
And you can feel you've got something to learn
You've got time to burnYou were lost inside a pounding heart
Waiting for the game to start
But you won't play you've so much to learn
Like you never say never
We'll live forever
And you've got time to burnWhen the wolf is loose in the city
The the city will fight to survive
You can hide in the streets of the city
But no one will care
No one will know you're alive
There's time to burn 
The night has a thousand eyes
But he moves in only places
Where the eyes can never beThe night tells a thousand lies
And when you wake up in the morning
Were you dreaming
Screaming
Tryin' to hide your burnin' heart
Before somebody cuts it all awaySunset superman
Sunset superman
Sunset supermanSomebody start the game
And the dark will just get louder
As it shouts away the lightA shadow without a name
But when he wakes up in the morning
He just won't know
Was he a hero
Trying to hide his burning heart
Before somebody cuts it all awaySunset superman
Sunset superman
Sunset superman
Anybody can, sunset supermanThe night has a thousand eyes
But he moves in only places
Where the eyes can never beThe night tells a thousand lies
And when you wake up in the morning

Tonight we run
We can hide in the dark
When the moon steals the light from the dying sun
Oh run
It's a better thing than we have ever done
There's a beast that lives inside you
And it's screaming to get out
Like the beat of a heart
Don't look behind
Cause a tear that never dries
Can only make you blind
You've got to try
Cause the future's never never gonna die
There's a beast that lives inside you
And it's screaming to get out
It's a storm that's never ending
It's a truth without a doubt
Tonight we run
We can hide in the dark
Till the moon steals the light from the sun
There's a beast that lives inside you
And it's screaming let me out
It's a storm that's never ending
It's a truth without a doubt
Love can be a whisper
But pain will always
Shout to you
Like the beat of a heart
Like the beat of a heart
Like the beat of a heart
Like the beat of a heart
Go Beat your Heart 
Well I've never been here before
But I'm coming back tomorrow
For the real pain a cold rain againNice day for a crucifixion
Heard a new prediction
That we can all be saved so I'll haveOne more for the road play it again
One more for the roadNever heard this before
That a child can tell who's evil
But it's a good thing if we sing alongCold day we can make a fire
Burn another liar
Can witches ever die hey let's burnOne more for the road gimme the same again
One more for the roadWell I've never been here before
And the room is really empty
But there's a big line waiting for the show
Nice day for an execution
Another wrong conclusion
But someone's got to pay so let's burnOne more for the road same again
One more for the roadThere's a child who just sees evil
And a man who just loves pain
But I've heard that we can't save them
So gimme me the same againThere's a cross that you can't carry
Cause it's heavier than hell
And if you should meet your maker
Just pray that he won't yell
One more for the roadOne more for the road
One more for the road
One more for the road 
Bless me father I must go away
To save us from the one's who don't believe
Confess me father I have sin but maybe
Angels really sing
Fot the man who would be kingWe laugh at your religion
You people of the sand
We have no superstition
You can read it in our handsForgive me father for the change we bring
But it's all for the man who would be kingDon't leave a body standing
Not the holy not the small
Deliver us from evil
If it's yours we want it allLately father I've been wondering
Is the devil just the man who would be kingHow can right be ever wrong
We are glory we are stronger than youWe never got an answer
But it's just too late to ask
The bloody flag was waving
And our hearts just ran too fastCurse me father for the chains we bring
And don't believe the man who would be kingWe never got an answer
Cause the question slipped my mind
I've been so busy killing
That I haven't found the right time 
All you see down there
Could be yours for the taking
All your heart's desired
Would be yours but you don't want it
You don't want it
You keep telling meStay out of my mind
Stay out of my soul
I can't get you out of my life
So stay out of my mind
Stay out of my mind, yeahWhat do you want from life
What do you keep living for
Is it worth the price
It'll cost you nothing
But you won't take it
You won't take it
You keep telling meStay out of my mind
Stay out of my soul
I can't get you out of my life
So stay out of my mind
Stay out of my mind 
If there isn't light when no one sees
Then how can I know what you might believe?
A story told that can't be real
Somehow must reflect the truth we feel, yeahFade away, fade away
Vanish into small
Fade away, fade away
Break the crystal ball oh!It's the sign
Feels like the time!On a small world, west of wonder
Somewhere, nowhere all
There's a rainbow that will shimmer
When the summer falls
If an echo darts in dancer
When it hears a certain song
Then the beast is free to wander
But never is seen aroundAnd it's the sign of the southern cross
It's the sign of the southern cross
All right
Sail away
To the sign
OhFrom the book, the word is spoken
Whispers from forgotten psalms
Gather all around the young ones
They will make us strong
Reach above your dreams of pleasure
Given life to those who died
Look beyond your own horizons
Sail the ship of signsAnd it's the sign of the southern cross
It's the sign of the southern cross
Fade away, fade away
Break the crystal ball
Fade away, fade away
I can't accept it anymoreOn a real world, west of wonder
Somewhere, nowhere all
There's a rainbow, see it shimmer
When the summer falls
From the book, the word is spoken
Whispers from forgotten psalms
Gather all around the young ones
They will make us strong!It's the sign of the southern cross
It's the sign of the southern crossDon't live for pleasure
Make life your treasure
Fade away!
Eight miles high, about to fall
And no one there to catch you
Look for the sign, the time
The sign of the southern cross, yeah 
Waiting for the revolution
New clear vision, genocide
Computerize God, it's the new religion
Program the brain, not the heartbeatOnward all you crystal soldiers
Touch tomorrow, energize
Digital dreams
And you're the next correction
Man's a mistake so we'll fix it, yeahTake a look at your own reflection
Right before your eyes
It turns to steel[Chorus:]
There's another side of heaven
This way, to technical paradise
Find it on the other side
When the walls fall downLove is automatic pleasure
Virtual reality
Terminal hate, it's a calculation
Send in the child for connectionTake a look at the toys around you
Right before your eyes
The toys are real[Chorus]Midnight confessions
Never heal the soul
What you believe is fantasyYour past is your future
Left behind
Lost in time
Will you surrenderWaiting for the revolution
Program the brain
Not the heartbeatDeliver us to evil
Deny us of our faith
Robotic hearts bleed poison
On the world we populateVirtual existence
With a superhuman mind
The ultimate creation
Destroyer of mankindTermination of our youth
For we do not compute
No! 
Oh no, here it comes again
Can't remember when we came so close to love before
Hold on, good things never last
Nothing's in the past, it always seems to come again
Again and again and againCry out to legions of the brave
Time again to save us from the jackals of the street
Ride out, protectors of the realm
Captain's at the helm, sail across the sea of lightsCircles and rings, dragons and kings
Weaving a charm and a spell
Blessed by the night, holy and bright
Called by the toll of the bellBloodied angels fast descending
Moving on a never-bending light
Phantom figures free forever
Out of shadows, shining ever-brightNeon Knights
Neon Knights
All rightCry out to legions of the brave
Time again to save us from the jackals of the street
Ride out, protectors of the realm
Capatin's at the helm, sail across the sea of lights
Again and again, again and again and againNeon Knights
Neon Knights
Neon Knights
All right 
I'm all right- I'm crossing over
I just shot the sun
One more night black as heaven
So no-one saw the gunRunning with monsters in shadows
And monsters always know
It's better in the darkOh, she's all right - tall and handsome
If the lights are down
Gone by dawn - takes no chances
Might come back aroundClutching to monsters in shadows
And monsters always know
It's better in the darkI'm all right I'm crossing over
I can disappear goneClutching to monsters in shadows
And monsters always know
It's better in the dark
Better in the dark
I just shot the sun 
I love the night
So many shadows
Unholy light
Putting out the spark
Leave 'em in the dark - forever
OohI can wait for you
Your end is my life
All lies are true
Secrets of the heart
And you can take them all - To heavenI don't feel pain or sorrow
The child's a man tomorrow
Crossing the line - Then he's mineDon't care which god you follow
Whose promises you swallow
Time and again
We must meet at the end
AaahIt's all right
When the music is over
Come on and dance
For the lord of the last dayI love the night
So many shadows
Unholy light
Secrets of the heart
Leave 'em in the dark
Forever[choir] 
Shame on the night
For places I've been
And what I've seen
For giving me the strangest dreams
But you never really know just what they mean
Oh so shame on the night
Oh rightAnd shame on you
You've stolen the day
Snatched it away
But I saw the sky
An I never want to die
Now you know the reason why
I said, oh shame on the nightYou don't care what you've done
So I think I'd better runShame on the sun
For the light you sold
I've lost my hold
On the magic flame
And now I know your name
Oh Lord just go the way you came again
Oh shame on the nightYou don't care what you've done
So I know I'd better runShame on the night
For places I've been
And what I've seen
Forgive me the strangest dreams
You never, never, never, never know just what they mean
And oh shame on the nightYou don't care what you've done
Here I go I've got to run 
Seems like heard this song a thousand times before
He just wanted her but she wants more
So build a wall
Keep it all to herself, ohAlways never seemed to be too much
Reaching out became a spider's touch
Wrapped in chains
Sad remains
Another victim ofOver love
Over loveHe was just the devil in a thing disguise
Jealousy behind the greenest eyes
Turn the page
Close the cage
On another victim ofOver love
Over love, yeah
Over love
Over love
Over love, over loveMamma never left her baby all alone
Baby never knew when she was grown
Now mamma's gone
And come the dawn
You got another victim ofOver love
Over love
Over love
Over love, love, love, love, love
Over love 
You never sing for pleasure
You only make the sounds
You never feel the magic
'Cause you think the world is roundAnd you never dance in moonlight
You run but you never move
You don't believe in someday
And the truth is what you proveBut it's alright
Well, it's alright
Just another dayToo many chains around you
You laugh but you never smile
You don't belong in heaven
But you're here all the whileAnd it's alright
Well, it's alright
Just another day
Another day
Another dayAnother day to let you down
Another way that they have found
Yes, another day, another way
Another way, another dayYou never sing for pleasure
You only make the sounds
You never feel the magic
'Cause you think the world is spinning round for youBut it's alright
Yes, it's alright
Well, it's alright
Just another day 
There's a crack in the rainbow
There's a hole in the sky
You believed in something
Now it's just a lie, yeahNo jokes from the jester
Not a laugh from the clown
And your world is upside down, yeahYou can hide in a circle
It's a way to survive
Be another number
At least you'd be aliveOr you can ride with the gypsy
He can take you to hell
And the answers screaming
In a voice you know so wellYou you're made of fire
Never higher
You were made to runYou you're burning higher
You've got the fire
You were born on the sunSo take a walk with a wild one
It's the way that I've found
You can turn it upside down 
Remember when you only needed no one
Every day's tomorrow
And it's all right
No confessions - not for you
Forget the things you've done
It's what you'll doThe first time you're suspicious
What's that gliding down
Along comes a spiderSuddenly the world has no more changes
You've run with an evil woman
So it's all right
No more strangers' candy lies
The light is so much better for your eyesNow I'm not superstitious
But every time you've tried
Along comes a spiderDon't ask why - it's the long way around
Just go wildWhy do we believe in conversation
We never seem to listen
We only hearNow you don't need permission
But don't get caught next time
Along comes a spider
A spider
A spider
Inside her 
It's just a matter of time
He was the victim and he never saw the crime
He had invisible eyes
He told you truth but you were sure of it, lies'Cause he was twisted (you could see it)
He was twisted, all rightHe was the fortunate one
He could have pulled the trigger
But he couldn't get the gun
They told him that he was blind
He didn't understand
'Cause he could see them insideThey were twisted, oh
So Twisted
You could feel it they were
Twisted
Twisted up insideLook inside any window
Come on and see the show
It's the same generation
They set you free
But they just won't let you go, noIt was a matter of time
They told me I was guilty
So I thought I did the crime
I never learned how to cry
And when I told the truth
They were sure it was a lie
Sure that I would cry
Sure of it
Sure of it 'cause I'm so
TwistedShe's twisted up inside
They're twisted
We're twisted
And when you're twisted
There's just no place to hide away 
Here's to you! Here's to me!
Masters of the universe
The curse of destinyAll for one, it's one for all
Now you can pull the trigger
As we're knocking down on the wall
When you finally shoot too high
The lie will always bring it down
You resurrection angels,
Look what we found
That the wheel goes around
So here's to you!Come on, raise the dead
Heads will roll
Cancel the infection
We can purify the soulDo the crime
Then write the law
There's no wrong you can change it where
A change you've never sawHey, you desperation angels
Here we found
That they all fell down
So
Here's to me! Here's to you!Here's to you! Here's to me!
Here's to reason!
Here's to me! Here's to you!
Raise the dead! Here's to freedom! 
I think I'm through with just pretending
Knocking at a door
That I've been through before
Congratulations - at last you've seen my light
Now it's you against the nightI think I'm never coming after - after all
Now I've become the cat
Who always lets you know thatI Am I Am - stronger than the wind
I Am I Am sin
I Am I Am - stronger without you
I AmFor all the words gone unspoken
Silence isn't gold
Or the story's never told
Investigation - at last I've found my light
And we shineSo now I'm like the cat
Who always tells you this thatI Am I Am - stronger than the wind
I Am I Am sin
I Am I Am better without you
I AmI think I'm way outside illusion
Breaking down the door
That locked me in before
Congratulations - now that you've see my light - after allAnd when I become the cat
I'll always let you know thatI Am I Am - stronger than the wind
I Am I Am sin
I Am I Am - stronger without you
I AmI Am I Am - brighter than the sun
I Am I Am everyone
I Am I Am - better without you
I AmI Am I Am - stronger than before
I Am I Am more
I Am I Am - ready to go on
I Am 
You've ridden on a carousel
So you know the feeling
As the ring slips through your fingersSometimes you justify it
But there's the sword
And you're bleeding once againBefore you're in a corner
Can't crawl away
Here's a way to save youYou gotta push
Get out of my way and push
You can turn the wheel
Push
One more pushYou're master of the broken heart
And so you know the feeling
As your soul starts going under
Sometimes you rectify it
Then out of the blue
The hammer falls againBefore you're in the water
Can't sail away
Here's a way to save youYou gotta push
Break the body down
Oh push
Out of my way I'll push
You better pushYou gotta push
Hands against the wall
And push
Out of my way we'll push
You can turn the wheel
Go on and push
Push
Push
Push
Push 
When a milion miles from no where
Is still too close to home
You're with a hundred thousand people
And you still feel all aloneShe was never in the circle
Or the round would be a square
And the more she seemed to want it
The less they seemed to careSold out and no admission
Too late to buy
It's never who it's only why
She's living the lieWhen you're on your way to somewhere
But the elevator falls
Do you look for stairs to heaven
Or wander through the hallsHe was only dedicated
To the ones who make the law
But they burned with too much fire
And his heart was made of strawNo ticket - no admission
Too late to buy
It's always he and he knows why
He's living the lieBreak down
How bad do you want it
How far will you goIf you're looking at tomorrow
To forget about today
Then the past will be your future
And it's there you'll always stayWhat about the pictures
That smile from magazines
The ultimate temptation
Our new kings and all our queensSuch heat and too much pressure
Not worth the try
No more for them
Now it's I
And no more living the lie
Living the lie
Oh why
Live the lie 
Inside the walls I've made
To keep out all who reach for me
I might have lost my way
And I can't come out againDon't come around here anymore
You may infect yourself
Don't ever cross this line
You could see monsters in your mind
There just like meHave I erased all sense of touch
I don't feel anything
Sometimes they say I need
Sometimes I think I need
Sometimes I know I need
New parts for my brainMost dreams, they're black and white
But I must color mine
Each day's another end
Less night of screaming
Shouting at the outside
Someone let me inSet me free now no-one can
Faces at the window
Stop the water, bags of sand
Institutional manSometimes they say I need
Sometimes I think I need
Sometimes I know I need
New parts for my brainSet me free now no-one can
Faces at the window
Lock the cages, tie my hands
Institutional, institutional man 
Alright, Dark touches send rushed through the brain
Black's whiter, burns brighter than the flame
No shadows, just whispers in the wind
No faces, just places to begin
I just come seeking pleasure,
I hate the lightI speed at night, at night, alrightMy demons, they seem to disappear
No vision, I only see to hear
Protection, I never needed none
Direction, just nowhere near the sun
You've go some stairs to heaven,
You may be right
I only know in my world,
I hate the light(I speed at night)
Alrigth
Dark touches send rushed through the brain
Black's whiter, burns brighter than the flame
No shadows, just whispers in the wind
No faces, just places to beginYou've got some stair to heaven, you may be right
I only know in my world,
I hate the light I speed at nightI speed at night?
I speed at night, night, night, night
I speed at night, night, night, night
No shadows, no faces, just whispers in dark places
(I speed at night) 
Tired of living in the black and white?
Where fools can tell you that you're never right
I know a place where the film's in color
Just step inside of yourself
Here's a place in the front row
So on with the showThe same old shadow on the run
That's no shadow, it's your shadow's sonI know a place where the pools got water
And you don't need to know how to swim
Here's the key to the back door
Do you want more
Do you need more?Same old rhythm to the same old rhyme
The same old clock - same old timeThere's a place where the grass is greener
And you can shake, rattle and roll
Here's the key to the front door
Do you want more
Will you need more?Tired of living in the black and white
Where no-one's wrong and you're never right
Same old steps to the same old dance
Just one more reason - one more chance
Oh 
In the misty morning, on the edge of time
We've lost the rising sun, a final sign
As the misty morning rolls away to die
Reaching for the stars, we blind the skyWe sailed across the air before we learned to fly
We thought that it could never end
We'd glide above the ground before we learned to run, run
Now it seems our world has come undoneOh they say that it's over
And it just had to be
Ooh they say that it's over
We're lost children of the sea, ohWe made the mountains shake with laughter as we played
Hiding in our corner of the world
Then we did the demon dance and rushed to nevermore
Threw away the key and locked the doorOh they say that it's over, yeah
And it just had to be
Yes they say that it's over
We're lost children of the seaIn the misty morning, on the edge of time
We've lost the rising sun, a final sign
As the misty morning rolls away to die
Reaching for the stars, we blind the skyOh they say that it's over, yeah
And it just had to be
Oh they say that it's over
Poor lost children of the sea, yeahLook out! The sky is falling down!
Look out! The world is spinning round and round and round!
Look out! The sun is going black, black
Look out! It's never never never coming back, look out! 
Though you've decided that our love is wrong
And think that we should part
It seems as though I have loved you so long
You'll always be in my heart.Is it a sin
Is it a crime
Loving you dear like I do
If it's a crime then I'm guilty
Guilty of loving you.Maybe I'm wrong dreaming of you
Dreaming the lonely night through
If it's a crime then I'm guilty
Guilty of dreaming of youWhat can I do
What can I say
After I've taken the blame?
You say we're through
You'll go your way
But I'll always feel just the same. 
He was ready to rock and roll
So ready to lose control
But when a hungry heart
Gets a taste of freedom you better look outHe was ready to push and shove
Ready to fight for love
But I've seen it before
And it can make you crazy
The eyes are what you seeWhy are they watching meShe was ready to black and white
The colors were just too bright
She loved to fly
But she hated fallingShe was caught in the in-between
Her dirty would not come clean
She ran for light
But she just got darknessJust when you think you're free
The eyes are what you seeWhy are they watching me
Why do they do the things they do
Why are they watching me
Watching youIf only the eyes could see
Then you'd know your destiny
The mind is an enemy
And you just need a friendAre you ready for rock and roll
Ready to take control
If you see the eyes
Will it make you crazy crazy
Crazy 
She never breaks into the conversation
He seems to be the reason why she lives
She tries to be the perfect kind of stranger
But we always seem to love the most
The ones who never give, yeahIt's between two hearts
A personal situation
Between two hearts
The kind of love with a reputationWe never have to ask her why she's crying
The smile she has been kicked into a frown
But still it makes her day to be his pleasure
Should we open up her eyes
Can we ever break the spell
No one can tellIt's between two hearts
A personal combination
Between too hearts
The kind of love with a bad reputationPut on your party faces and come along
Join in the big parade
Here comes the camera
Do you look as good as your sister
Smile at the animals
They should be the ones in the cages
Turn the pagesAnother way to spend a rainy Sunday
Waiting for a call that never comes
The mystery is how she makes her choices
But don't we always choose
The ones who hide the sun
EveryoneIt's between two hearts
Love and desperation
Between two hearts
The kind of love
The kind of loveBetween two hearts
A personal situation
Between two hearts
The kind of love with a reputation 
Now that my dreams have gone dead
I see them burning in the fire
Just like the words that I've said
Ashes turned to ashes once againLook for a sign in the air
A light that dances in the sky
Maybe you'll see it somewhere
Oh, shining like a diamond
Promising that hope will never dieI might know the answer
Well, it's back there in my brain
Someday soon I'll be rising again
Higher than the sunI have been father and son
I cry for children of the night
Just because tears have begun
Beware of quiet voices
Thunder comes from silence - I am light 
Close the city and tell the people that something's coming to call
Death and darkness are rushing forward to take a bite from the wall, ohYou've nothing to say
They're breaking away
If you listen to fools
The Mob Rules
The Mob RulesKill the spirit and you'll be blinded, the end is always the same
Play with fire, you burn your fingers and lose your hold of the flame, ohIt's over, it's done
The end is begun
If you listen to fools
The Mob RulesYou've nothing to say
Oh, they're breaking away
If you listen to foolsBreak the circle and stop the movement, the wheel is thrown to the ground
Just remember it might start rolling and take you right back aroundYou're all fools!
The Mob Rules!

So I know he must need me 
When there's lightning, you know it always brings me down
'Cause it's free and I see that it's me
Who's lost and never found
I cry out for magic, I feel it dancing in the light
It was cold, I lost my hold
To the shadows of the nightNo sign of the morning coming
You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow in the dark
A rainbow in the darkDo your demons, do they ever let you go?
When you've tried, do they hide, deep inside
Is it someone that you know
You're just a picture, your're an image caught in time
We're a lie, you and I
We're words without a rhymeThere's no sign of the morning coming
You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow in the dark
Just a rainbow in the dark, yeahWhen I see lightning, you know it always brings me down
'Cause it's free and I see that it's me
Who's lost and never found
Feel the magic, I feel it floating in the air
But it's fear, and you'll hear
It calling you bewareLook out
There's no sight of the morning coming
There's no sight of the day
You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow
Like a rainbow in the dark, yeah
You're a rainbow in the dark
Just a rainbow in the dark
No sign of the morning
You're a rainbow in the dark 
Who cares what came before
We were only starlight
One day, then nevermore
Because we're whispers in the windOnce upon a time
The world was never blind
Like we areRight now it seems
You're only dreams and shadows
If wishes could be eagles how you'd flyThis is your life
This is your time
What if the flame won't last forever
This is your here
This is your now
Let it be magicalWho cares what came before
We're only starlightOnce upon the time
All the world was blind
Like we areThis is your life
This is your time
Look at your world
This is your life 
There's perfect harmony
In the rising and the falling of the sea
And as we sail along
I never fail to be astounded by the things we'll do for promises
And a songWe are the innocent
We are the damned
We were caught in the middle of the madness
Hunted by the lion and the lamb oh, ohWe bring you fantasy
We bring you pain
It's your one great chance for a miracle
Or we will disappear
Never to be seen againAnd all the fools sailed away
All the fools sailed away
Sailed awayWe bring you beautiful
We teach you sin
We can give you a piece of the universe
Or we will disappear
Never to return againAnd all the fools sailed away
All the fools sailed away
All the fools sailed away
They sailed away
Sailed awayAnd as we drift along
I never fail to be astounded by the things we'll do for promises
And a songWe are the innocent
We cut we bleed
We're your one great chance for a miracle
And a miracle is something you needThey'll take your diamonds
And then give you steel
You'll be caught in the middle of the madness
Just lost like them
And part of all the pain that they feel, yeahAnd all the fools sailed away
All the fools sailed away
All the fools sailed away
Leaving nothing, nothing more to say
All the fools sailed awayThey say you're beautiful
And they'll always let you in
But doors are never open
To the child without a trace of sinSail away 
Looking inside of yourself
You might see someone you don't know
Maybe it's just what you need
Letting the river in you flowYou can sail away to the sun
And let it burn you while you can
Or walk a long bloody road
Like the hero who never ranYou'll feel it
You'll feel it
You'll feel the rush of it allFlying away int the clouds
You know you're loosing your control
And finding you way in the dark
Like some poor forgotten soulYou'll feel it
You'll see it
You'll feel the rush of the city lights
You'll feel it
I see it in your eyes, you'reCaught in the middle
Just like the way you've always been
Caught in the middle
Helpless againLooking inside of yourself
You might see someone you don't know
Maybe it's just what you need
Letting the river I know that's in you flowYou can feel it
You can see it
You know the rush of thunder, yeah
You'll feel it
I see it in your eyes, you'reCaught in the middle
Just like the way you've always been
Caught in the middle
Helpless again
Like the rush of a thunder
That brings you under
There's some kind of spark
You're caught right there in the middle
You're caught in the middle
Caught in the middle again
All night long yeah hmm hmm hmm
You break it off in the middle 
Hey the old ones speak of winter, the young ones praise the sun
And time just slips away
Oh running into nowhere turning like a wheel
And a year becomes a dayWhenever we dream that's when we fly
So here is a dream for just you and IWe'll find the sacred heart, somewhere bleeding in the night, yeah
Look for the light and find the sacred heartOh here we see the wizard staring through the glass
And he's pointing right at you
Now you can see tomorrow the answer and the lie
And the things you've got to do, yeahOh, sometimes you never fall, and ah, you're the lucky one
But oh, sometimes you want it all you've got to reach for the sunAnd find the sacred heart, somewhere bleeding in the night
Oh look to the lightYou fight to kill the dragon you bargain with the beast
Then you sail into a sight
You run along the rainbow and never leave the ground
Still you don't know whyWhenever you dream you're holding the key
I opens the door to let you be freeAnd find the sacred heart, somewhere bleeding in the night
Run for the light and you'll find the sacred heartA shout comes from the wizard the sky begins to crack
And he's looking right at you, quick
Run along the rainbow before it turns to black, attackAnd oh, sometimes you never fall, and ah, you're the lucky one
Oh, sometimes you need it all you've got to reach for the sunAnd find the sacred heart yeah, somewhere bleeding in the night
Find the sacred heart 
If your circle stays unbroken
Then you're a lucky man
'Cause it never, never, never has for meIn the palace of the virgin
Lies the chalice of the soul
And it's likely you might find the answer thereShe had thirteen years of teenage tears
And never a helping hand
She had fourteen more of rain before
She saw the sight of land
She was a photograph just ripped in half
A smile inside a frown
And the the light, the answer right
Inside her coming downIt said
I can go away
I can leave here
I can be invisible
I go awayHe was just eighteen and in-between
A lady and a man
His daddy's girl in momma's world
That was when he ran
You know the word confused has been abused
But that's just what he was
And then the spark inside the dark
The answer came because it saidYou can go away
You can leave here
You can be invisibleWell I grew up quick and I felt the kick
Of life upon a stage
So I bought the book and took a fast look
At just the very last page
It was a single word that I'd just heard
From the two that came before
The only way to really stay
Is to walk right out the doorSo you can go away
I'm gonna leave here
I can be invisibleAnd go away again
I can go away
When I leave here
I can be invisibleI said, when you can go away
Lord you know it's right to leave here
So I just become invisible
I went away
I disappeared before your eyes
You never touch me you never feel me
You'll never see me again
Because I've just become unseen
Well I'm a photograph that's been torn in half
We're all eighteen and we're in between
We need a helping hand to the holy land
To be invisible
To go away 
Oh no - they're at it again
Looking inside my secrets
Coming through cracks before I mend the wallGet out - cause you're breaking the law
How did you ever find me
Places where I can hide can't get much smallerI have invisible dreams
Where no one can touch me
Maybe I'll find a way to disappearNo one moves - and no one dies
Just the eyesI've run as fast as I can
Thinking they'll never catch me
What a waste of breath a waste of timeFeel like digging a hole
Going in even deeper
Maybe they just can't see what just can't shineI'll be lost - so no goddbyes
If no one moves then nothing dies
Just the eyesOh no - they've done it again
Sending out the detectives
Searching for signs of life and that means meIn my invisible dreams
When no one is watching
I'd make the whole world blind and I'd be freeI'll be lost - so no replies
If no one looks then no one dies
Just the eyes
Those eyesMagic numbers
Even sacrifice
I can't find a way
Cause nothing stops the eyes 
Someone said
You'll light up the universe
It's there in your head then
Crazy comes to callBreak me down
I'm only an everyone
Running from free
Running from meAnd though it's not of my choosing
I'm losing my insanity
AgainSomeone said
Forever was yesterday
So open your head when
Crazy comes aroundBreak me down

Howl at the moon
Knowing that soonAnd though it's always confusing

Said you got a choice
The hammer or the nailYou'll be ridin'

And she was chosen for the crown
But chains can't stop the soundOf one night in the city
One night looking prettyThen someone opened doorways
And Johnny slipped away
Running for the bright,
Where dark is always light
But there's no day, no wayThe princess saw the dark child
And the dark child said her nameCome steal away, we'll play the gameDo you watch, do you see

In the city, one night in the city 
In the land of the lost horizon
Where the queen lies dark and cold
And when the stars won't shine, then the story's told yeahWhen the world was milk and honey
And the magic was strong and true
Then the strange ones came and the people knewThat the chains are on
That the chains are onMy, my, my in the land of no tomorrow
Where you pray just to end each day
And your life just slowly melts awayEach day you hear the sand as it moves and whispers
Come and sail on my golden sea
Maybe one day you'll be just like me and that's freeBut still your chains are on
Yes your chains are on
Still your chains are onYou've seen them walking on the water
You've seen flying through the sky
They were frightening in the darkness
They had rainbows in their eyesWhen the world was milk and honey
And the magic was strong and true
The the strange ones came and the people knewYeah that the chains are on
(That the chains are on)That the chains are on in the land of the lost horizon
Where the chains are on
In the land of world was milk and honey
Still your chains are on
Where the queen lies dark and lonely
Still the chains are on
And the world was new and magic
But the chains are on, and the chains are on
Oh the chains are on
Yeah the chains are on, oh the chains are on
And the chains are on, see them walking on the water
And the chains are on, see them flying through the sky
They we're frightening in the darkness (yes chains are on)
They had rainbows in their eyes (the chains are on)

It has been a thousand years since the once powerful
planet of Blessing lost its life-giving two suns, and
countless millennia since the days of the great
magicians. An expedition of alien voyagers came upon
the now ice-covered sphere, drawn there by an
unexplained lone beacon far below the miles of frozen
moisture, they unlocked a written history of Blessing
from its almost undiscovered tomb. So begins the story
of Magica.It was a time of celebration. The Book of Magica and
the wizards who had used its spells so wisely for the
good of the people were being honored in all the great
cities of the world. There was however an exception.
Where good thrives, evil survives and evil has plans
for survival.The celebration of thanks and prosperity would signal
the forces of Evilsyde to begin the attack and
ultimate capture and destruction of Magica. The spells
from the Book would be used to turn all of those
unwilling to join Evilsyde into statues of stone and
send their spirits to Otherworld, where they would
eventually be assimilated into the energy needed to
drive Evilsyde, and maintain its power without the
necessity of the Book and its incantations forever.Defenses were naturally relaxed during the festive
preparations and although the battle was well-fought
by both factions, the minions of the dark prevailed.
Their assault was well-planned and executed to a
fault. After overwhelming their initial opposition,
they pushed on to the sacred ground upon which the
Book of Magica rested. They possessed a much weaker
form of magic themselves, and although it would be
normally quite useless against the strength of Magica,
the inability of the Wizards to gather themselves
together in time, coupled with the perfect timing and
determination of the attackers, spelled doom for the
Book and its followers.The leader of the insurrection was the high priest and
executioner known as Shadowcast. His presence could
make the naughtiest of children become obedient and
inspire great fear among the adult population. This
man, most vile, would now be ruler of all and
answerable to none. His reign would plunge Blessing
into eternal darkness and prepare the way for the
coming of his master, Astoroth, the Grand Duke of Hell.The capture of Magica did not, however, mean that
Shadowcast had finally reached his goal. He must now
find and conquer Blessing's Grand Wizard and legendary
hero, Eriel. Eriel, who defeated Evilsyde time and
again with his understanding and use of Magica's
spells. He would be the last stumbling block of total
domination.Eriel had removed himself from the general population
in anticipation of everlasting peace and now he
devoted all of his energy to meditation and praise of
his God. Lately though, he had been visited by many
temptations in his dreams. Promises of pleasure,
riches and power raced through his sleeping mind. All
these lures had been placed there by Shadowcast,
hoping to avoid confrontation between this dominant
man and his own villainous forces. Eriel however had
resisted these solicitations and was now warned of
some impending danger. He managed to make his way to
the sacred ground by cloaking his identity with simple
spells, only to be discovered just before his attempt
to rescue the Book of Magica, but not before he was
able to memorize the most important of Magica's
charms, The spell of Restoration.The ceremony of thanksgiving was now directed toward
the transmission of spirits to Otherworld. One by one
the good souls of Blessing were turned to stone and
sent on to their grisly fate, until only the noble
Eriel remained. The spectacle that followed was meant
to degrade Eriel and raise the courage of the cowardly
supplicants of Evilsyde, but true to his
indominantable bearing, he promised to return and
banish Evilsyde forever. Then he was gone.The horrors of Otherworld are now revealed to the
masses huddled together for some small measure of
comfort. First the adults were separated from their
children amid cries and pleas for help. Next the old
ones were taken away and assigned to a place very near
the assimilation site. They were guarded by monstrous,
misshapen denizens of this shrouded netherland, who
constantly harangued the inmates with promises of pain
and extermination. Intermittent bursts of flame shot
up from jagged cracks in the ground, threatening to
consume anyone in its path. Shrieks of torment could
be heard piercing the murky atmosphere, further
unnerving the petrified captives. Only one seemed
unaffected by all the inflicted fear and turmoil.Eriel's strength and determination soon pacified the
men and women with whom he was confined. When they all
became more calm and subdued, he began to speak to
them softly as an adult to his children. "Long ago you
entrusted me to protect the Book of Magica and to be
faithful to its special purpose. It must seem that I
have failed you and condemned us all to oblivion, but
fear not! This hell is only a test of your faith and
resolve. The power of Magica did not vanish in fire.
On the third day I will evoke the spell of
Restoration. United we shall return to Blessing and,
armed with the strength of Magica, we will be
triumphant. Many will perish, but Magica and our souls
cannot be restored until three days have passed. Take
heart my friends. Victory awaits you."Even magic has its limitations and as Eriel explained
to his flock, the spell could not be activated until a
waiting period of at least three days. One third of
the souls of Blessing would be melded into the
Evilsyde collective before Eriel could be effective
with the words of Restoration.The old ones were the first to go. Cries of
encouragement and hope were shouted to the condemned
as they trudged slowly to their fate. One by one they
were thrown into the assimilation chamber where a
blinding blue spark gave evidence of their demise.
With each burst Eriel's heavy heart ached with guilt
for his part in this slaughter of his charges. If only
he had not become so complacent. He above
all should never have let this tragedy transpire.In the compound holding the young adults, an
insurrection of sorts was occurring. A boy of
seventeen years called Challis was urging an uprising
among his captured companions. Futile though it was,
it earned Challis a place in the cell adjoining
Eriel's. His rantings and ravings were soon quelled by
Eriel's quiet urging and the two settled into serious
conversation. Eriel knew his time of assimilation was
near and only hoped it would not be scheduled before
the three day waiting period for Restoration was
ended. Shadowcast wanted to personally oversee Eriel's
termination but couldn't abandon his duties on Blessing
until all was secure.Would there be enough time?Eriel realized some of his own strong qualities in
Challis and decided that this was an opportunity not
to be lost. He instructed Challis to remove all anger
from his mind and hate from his heart. Only the pure
could receive and transmit this most important of
spells. Convinced that this young man was ready, he
joined with his spirit and gave him these words.
"Sanasha Gorath Sollis Arcanna," Words that would
resurrect the masses if delivered correctly and in time.Over two days had passed before Shadowcast was ready
for travel to Otherworld to deliver Eriel to his fate.
His journey through Otherworld was marked by what
could pass for cheers, if they weren't shouted from
the mouths of utterly inhuman shapes and forms. Upon
his arrival he instructed the guards to take him
straight to Eriel. Once there he announced with great
satisfaction that he would personally supervise
Eriel's execution in a matter of hours. Nearby,
Challis loudly voiced his objection to this treatment
of his newly met hero and was rewarded by kicks and
punches until he could no longer speak. Eriel's heart
sank. Had he misjudged Challis and entrusted his
people's future to a reckless youth? Eriel's mind
wandered to his own younger days. He too had been
restless and foolhardy, but in time had outgrown these
traits and become the adored leader of Blessing. He
wondered if Challis had yet experienced love. Eriel
himself had turned his back on the beautiful and
innocent Annica. She was his intended from birth, but
he couldn't let love for this saintly child cloud his
duties to Blessing and the Book.One hour remained in the wait for Restoration. Eriel's
hopes were soaring. Surely Shadowcast would fail once
again. But as that thought surfaced, so did Evilsyde's
dark leader. Eriel was led away with head held high,
but as he passed Challis he gave just the slightest
nod. A gesture that wasn't lost on the youth. Eriel
was then taken to the assimilation chamber and
strapped to the cross-like structure in the middle of
the room. Seconds were all that stood in the way of
resurrection or destruction. Shadowcast walked to
Eriel, presumably to gloat one last time to his old
nemesis. Eriel welcomed the time that would be wasted,
but at the last moment Shadowcast seemed to reconsider
and raised his arm in signal for the end to begin. The
arm dropped and, with crackle and hiss, Eriel was no
more. Shadowcast and his minions erupted with joy.
Never again to be slaves. Now to be masters.Challis heard the cheering and knew that Eriel had
passed without time to summon the spell. Now only he
could influence the future. He heard the rattling of
armor and realized they were coming for him. Soon the
guards appeared and dragged the struggling Challis
from his confinement. One of his jailers struck him a
mighty blow across the face and suddenly all his anger
left him. He was sure of what he must do. Thunder
starts from silence and he would be thunder.Challis was taken to the chamber and secured to the
cross. Shadowcast approached him and asked if he had
any last thing to say before assimilation. Challis
smiled and said he did. Then with an evil laugh,
Shadowcast raised his arm and announced that his
question was only a final killing joke. It was now or
never. As the arm fell in signal, Challis shouted out
the spell: "Sanasha Gorath Sollis Arcanna" and all
hell actually broke loose. Challis and the good folk
of Blessing were bathed in an incredible rush of
light. Shadowcast and all his wicked throng writhed in
agony in the darkness they were spawned from, as the
fierce illumination sought them out and consumed each
troll, ogre and gargoyle in a horrible melting frenzy.
Shadowcast, hiding in the last black space to be
found, watched the light creep irresistibly toward
him. At the last moment he cloaked his body with his
unpriestly robe and muttered what sounded like an oath
as the light touched the cloth. The robe erupted into
flame and then there was nothing. Surely Shadowcast
was also consumed by fire! But that tale would not yet
be told. Now as each remaining citizen of Blessing was
transported instantly back to their home, they found
themselves standing among thousands of recognizable
stone statues. These monuments represented their
fallen comrades and would ever be a lasting testament
to the dangers of evil and the power of Magica.Now came the time of mourning. Funeral pyres
brightened the night sky for weeks and songs of sorrow
could be heard across the land long after the flames
had sputtered and died. When the prolonged periods of
grieving had ended, the citizens and their council
directed attention to the task of anointing a new
leader and protector of the restored Book of Magica.
The choice seemed a simple one. Challis had
resurrected the populace and the Book, but many
questioned his youth and inexperience.The debate raged on as the time of choosing approached.
The candidates were summoned to the sacred
place. Eloquent speeches were made on behalf of them
all. Only Challis lacked a champion and it seemed
certain that he would be passed over. "Will anyone
speak for the boy?" asked the council. The question
was greeted by silence as the judges turned away to
cast their votes. Then the quiet was broken. A
handsome woman with golden hair, now flecked with
traces of gray, spoke: "Challis must be chosen. This
is the secret I have carried with me for all these
years. Although I was once rebuffed by my only true
love, Eriel, our brief union produced the young man
standing before you. Eriel was never to know that he
had sired this free spirit, but he will live on
through his son's achievements if you now find him
worthy." So spoke Annica, mother of Challis.The decision was now reached quickly. Annica's
revelation left little doubt in the minds of the
councillors that Challis should indeed succeed his
father. Evilsyde had been defeated, Shadowcast was
hopefully destroyed, Challis had been chosen to lead
his people and, despite the huge number of casualties,
the old way of life began again. But, evil does not
easily die. Shadowcast did indeed survive and persist
in his attempts to challenge and conquer Blessing.
Great battles would be fought. Brave heroes would rise
to the occasion and legends were created. There was,
of course, the unforgettable War of the Darkpeace when
Challis..... Ah! But that's another story! 
Sing me a song, you're a singer
Do me a wrong, you're a bringer of evil
The devil is never a maker
The less that you give, you're a taker
So it's on and on and on, it's heaven and hell
Oh wellThe lover of life's not a sinner
The ending is just a beginner
The closer you get to the meaning
The sooner you'll know that you're dreaming
So it's on and on and on, oh it's on and on and on
It goes on and on and on, Heaven and Hell
I can tell
Fool, foolOh uh
Yeah, yeah, yeahWell if it seems to be real, it's illusion
For every moment of truth, there's confusion in life
Love can be seen as the answer, but nobody bleeds for the dancer
And it's on and on, on and on and on and on and on and on and onThey say that life's a carousel
Spinning fast, you've got to ride it well
The world is full of kings and queens
Who blind your eyes and steal your dreams
It's heaven and hell, oh wellAnd they'll tell you black is really white
The moon is just the sun at night
And when you walk in golden halls
You get to keep the gold that falls
It's heaven and hell, oh noFool, fool
You've got to bleed for the dancer
Fool, fool
Look for the answer
Fool, fool, fool 
A rumble of thunder, I'm suddenly under your spell
No rhyme or reason, or time of the season, but oh well
The darkened deliver, I shake and I shiver down your soul
You know what to cover, I think for another it's a story told
So get a good hold, yeahRegiment fooled you, you thought that you knew who you are
A simple equation, that's the relation, but that's gone too far
A time of suspicion, a special condition that we all know
So let it all go!Turn up the night!
Turn up the night!
Turn up the night, it feels so right!Night time sorrow, taken like a pain
Black will not become a white, it's all the same
Evil lurks in twilight, dances in the dark
Makes you need the movement, like a fire needs a spark to burn!A rumble of thunder, I'm suddenly under your spell
No rhyme or reason, or time of the season, but oh well
The darkened deliver, I shake and I shiver down your soul
So get a good hold, yeahTurn up the night!
Turn up the night!
Turn up the night, it feels so right!
Turn up the night!
Turn up the night!
If it feels right
Turn off the light!
Turn up the night!

Tonight we run
We can hide in the dark
When the moon steals the light from the dying sun
Oh run
It's a better thing than we have ever done
There's a beast that lives inside you
And it's screaming to get out
Like the beat of a heart
Don't look behind
Cause a tear that never dries
Can only make you blind
You've got to try
Cause the future's never never gonna die
There's a beast that lives inside you
And it's screaming to get out
It's a storm that's never ending
It's a truth without a doubt
Tonight we run
We can hide in the dark
Till the moon steals the light from the sun
There's a beast that lives inside you
And it's screaming let me out
It's a storm that's never ending
It's a truth without a doubt
Love can be a whisper
But pain will always
Shout to you
Like the beat of a heart
Like the beat of a heart
Like the beat of a heart
Like the beat of a heart
Go Beat your Heart 
Well I've never been here before
But I'm coming back tomorrow
For the real pain a cold rain againNice day for a crucifixion
Heard a new prediction
That we can all be saved so I'll haveOne more for the road play it again
One more for the roadNever heard this before
That a child can tell who's evil
But it's a good thing if we sing alongCold day we can make a fire
Burn another liar
Can witches ever die hey let's burnOne more for the road gimme the same again
One more for the roadWell I've never been here before
And the room is really empty
But there's a big line waiting for the show
Nice day for an execution
Another wrong conclusion
But someone's got to pay so let's burnOne more for the road same again
One more for the roadThere's a child who just sees evil
And a man who just loves pain
But I've heard that we can't save them
So gimme me the same againThere's a cross that you can't carry
Cause it's heavier than hell
And if you should meet your maker
Just pray that he won't yell
One more for the roadOne more for the road
One more for the road
One more for the road 
Bless me father I must go away
To save us from the one's who don't believe
Confess me father I have sin but maybe
Angels really sing
Fot the man who would be kingWe laugh at your religion
You people of the sand
We have no superstition
You can read it in our handsForgive me father for the change we bring
But it's all for the man who would be kingDon't leave a body standing
Not the holy not the small
Deliver us from evil
If it's yours we want it allLately father I've been wondering
Is the devil just the man who would be kingHow can right be ever wrong
We are glory we are stronger than youWe never got an answer
But it's just too late to ask
The bloody flag was waving
And our hearts just ran too fastCurse me father for the chains we bring
And don't believe the man who would be kingWe never got an answer
Cause the question slipped my mind
I've been so busy killing
That I haven't found the right time 
All you see down there
Could be yours for the taking
All your heart's desired
Would be yours but you don't want it
You don't want it
You keep telling meStay out of my mind
Stay out of my soul
I can't get you out of my life
So stay out of my mind
Stay out of my mind, yeahWhat do you want from life
What do you keep living for
Is it worth the price

But you won't take it
You won't take it
You keep telling meStay out of my mind
Stay out of my soul
I can't get you out of my life
So stay out of my mind
Stay out of my mind 
If there isn't light when no one sees
Then how can I know what you might believe?
A story told that can't be real
Somehow must reflect the truth we feel, yeahFade away, fade away
Vanish into small
Fade away, fade away
Break the crystal ball oh!It's the sign
Feels like the time!On a small world, west of wonder
Somewhere, nowhere all
There's a rainbow that will shimmer
When the summer falls
If an echo darts in dancer
When it hears a certain song
Then the beast is free to wander
But never is seen aroundAnd it's the sign of the southern cross
It's the sign of the southern cross
All right
Sail away
To the sign
OhFrom the book, the word is spoken
Whispers from forgotten psalms
Gather all around the young ones
They will make us strong
Reach above your dreams of pleasure
Given life to those who died
Look beyond your own horizons
Sail the ship of signsAnd it's the sign of the southern cross
It's the sign of the southern cross
Fade away, fade away
Break the crystal ball
Fade away, fade away
I can't accept it anymoreOn a real world, west of wonder
Somewhere, nowhere all

Whispers from forgotten psalms
Gather all around the young ones
They will make us strong!It's the sign of the southern cross
It's the sign of the southern crossDon't live for pleasure
Make life your treasure
Fade away!
Eight miles high, about to fall
And no one there to catch you
Look for the sign, the time
The sign of the southern cross, yeah 
Waiting for the revolution
New clear vision, genocide
Computerize God, it's the new religion
Program the brain, not the heartbeatOnward all you crystal soldiers
Touch tomorrow, energize
Digital dreams
And you're the next correction
Man's a mistake so we'll fix it, yeahTake a look at your own reflection
Right before your eyes
It turns to steel[Chorus:]
There's another side of heaven
This way, to technical paradise
Find it on the other side
When the walls fall downLove is automatic pleasure
Virtual reality
Terminal hate, it's a calculation
Send in the child for connectionTake a look at the toys around you
Right before your eyes
The toys are real[Chorus]Midnight confessions
Never heal the soul
What you believe is fantasyYour past is your future
Left behind
Lost in time
Will you surrenderWaiting for the revolution
Program the brain
Not the heartbeatDeliver us to evil
Deny us of our faith
Robotic hearts bleed poison
On the world we populateVirtual existence
With a superhuman mind
The ultimate creation
Destroyer of mankindTermination of our youth
For we do not compute
No! 
Oh no, here it comes again
Can't remember when we came so close to love before
Hold on, good things never last
Nothing's in the past, it always seems to come again
Again and again and againCry out to legions of the brave
Time again to save us from the jackals of the street
Ride out, protectors of the realm
Captain's at the helm, sail across the sea of lightsCircles and rings, dragons and kings
Weaving a charm and a spell

Moving on a never-bending light
Phantom figures free forever
Out of shadows, shining ever-brightNeon Knights

One more night black as heaven
So no-one saw the gunRunning with monsters in shadows
And monsters always know
It's better in the darkOh, she's all right - tall and handsome
If the lights are down
Gone by dawn - takes no chances
Might come back aroundClutching to monsters in shadows
And monsters always know
It's better in the darkI'm all right I'm crossing over
I can disappear goneClutching to monsters in shadows
And monsters always know
It's better in the dark
Better in the dark
I just shot the sun 
I love the night
So many shadows
Unholy light
Putting out the spark
Leave 'em in the dark - forever
OohI can wait for you
Your end is my life
All lies are true
Secrets of the heart
And you can take them all - To heavenI don't feel pain or sorrow
The child's a man tomorrow
Crossing the line - Then he's mineDon't care which god you follow
Whose promises you swallow
Time and again
We must meet at the end
AaahIt's all right
When the music is over
Come on and dance
For the lord of the last dayI love the night
So many shadows
Unholy light
Secrets of the heart
Leave 'em in the dark
Forever[choir]

Along comes a spiderSuddenly the world has no more changes
You've run with an evil woman
So it's all right
No more strangers' candy lies
The light is so much better for your eyesNow I'm not superstitious
But every time you've tried
Along comes a spiderDon't ask why - it's the long way around
Just go wildWhy do we believe in conversation
We never seem to listen
We only hearNow you don't need permission
But don't get caught next time
Along comes a spider
A spider
A spider
Inside her 
It's just a matter of time
He was the victim and he never saw the crime
He had invisible eyes
He told you truth but you were sure of it, lies'Cause he was twisted (you could see it)
He was twisted, all rightHe was the fortunate one
He could have pulled the trigger
But he couldn't get the gun
They told him that he was blind
He didn't understand
'Cause he could see them insideThey were twisted, oh
So Twisted
You could feel it they were
Twisted
Twisted up insideLook inside any window
Come on and see the show
It's the same generation
They set you free
But they just won't let you go, noIt was a matter of time
They told me I was guilty
So I thought I did the crime
I never learned how to cry
And when I told the truth
They were sure it was a lie
Sure that I would cry
Sure of it
Sure of it 'cause I'm so
TwistedShe's twisted up inside
They're twisted
We're twisted
And when you're twisted
There's just no place to hide away 
Here's to you! Here's to me!
Masters of the universe
The curse of destinyAll for one, it's one for all
Now you can pull the trigger
As we're knocking down on the wall
When you finally shoot too high
The lie will always bring it down
You resurrection angels,
Look what we found
That the wheel goes around
So here's to you!Come on, raise the dead
Heads will roll
Cancel the infection
We can purify the soulDo the crime
Then write the law

Here's to reason!
Here's to me! Here's to you!
Raise the dead! Here's to freedom! 
I think I'm through with just pretending
Knocking at a door
That I've been through before
Congratulations - at last you've seen my light
Now it's you against the nightI think I'm never coming after - after all
Now I've become the cat
Who always lets you know thatI Am I Am - stronger than the wind
I Am I Am sin
I Am I Am - stronger without you
I AmFor all the words gone unspoken
Silence isn't gold
Or the story's never told
Investigation - at last I've found my light
And we shineSo now I'm like the cat
Who always tells you this thatI Am I Am - stronger than the wind
I Am I Am sin
I Am I Am better without you
I AmI think I'm way outside illusion
Breaking down the door
That locked me in before
Congratulations - now that you've see my light - after allAnd when I become the cat
I'll always let you know thatI Am I Am - stronger than the wind
I Am I Am sin
I Am I Am - stronger without you
I AmI Am I Am - brighter than the sun
I Am I Am everyone
I Am I Am - better without you
I AmI Am I Am - stronger than before
I Am I Am more
I Am I Am - ready to go on
I Am 
You've ridden on a carousel
So you know the feeling
As the ring slips through your fingersSometimes you justify it
But there's the sword
And you're bleeding once againBefore you're in a corner
Can't crawl away
Here's a way to save youYou gotta push
Get out of my way and push
You can turn the wheel
Push
One more pushYou're master of the broken heart
And so you know the feeling
As your soul starts going under
Sometimes you rectify it
Then out of the blue
The hammer falls againBefore you're in the water
Can't sail away
Here's a way to save youYou gotta push
Break the body down
Oh push
Out of my way I'll push
You better pushYou gotta push
Hands against the wall
And push
Out of my way we'll push
You can turn the wheel
Go on and push
Push
Push
Push
Push 
When a milion miles from no where
Is still too close to home
You're with a hundred thousand people
And you still feel all aloneShe was never in the circle
Or the round would be a square
And the more she seemed to want it
The less they seemed to careSold out and no admission
Too late to buy
It's never who it's only why
She's living the lieWhen you're on your way to somewhere
But the elevator falls
Do you look for stairs to heaven
Or wander through the hallsHe was only dedicated
To the ones who make the law
But they burned with too much fire
And his heart was made of strawNo ticket - no admission
Too late to buy
It's always he and he knows why
He's living the lieBreak down
How bad do you want it
How far will you goIf you're looking at tomorrow
To forget about today
Then the past will be your future
And it's there you'll always stayWhat about the pictures
That smile from magazines
The ultimate temptation
Our new kings and all our queensSuch heat and too much pressure
Not worth the try
No more for them
Now it's I
And no more living the lie
Living the lie
Oh why
Live the lie 
Inside the walls I've made
To keep out all who reach for me
I might have lost my way
And I can't come out againDon't come around here anymore
You may infect yourself
Don't ever cross this line
You could see monsters in your mind
There just like meHave I erased all sense of touch
I don't feel anything
Sometimes they say I need
Sometimes I think I need
Sometimes I know I need
New parts for my brainMost dreams, they're black and white
But I must color mine
Each day's another end
Less night of screaming
Shouting at the outside
Someone let me inSet me free now no-one can
Faces at the window
Stop the water, bags of sand
Institutional manSometimes they say I need
Sometimes I think I need
Sometimes I know I need
New parts for my brainSet me free now no-one can
Faces at the window
Lock the cages, tie my hands
Institutional, institutional man 
Alright, Dark touches send rushed through the brain
Black's whiter, burns brighter than the flame
No shadows, just whispers in the wind
No faces, just places to begin
I just come seeking pleasure,
I hate the lightI speed at night, at night, alrightMy demons, they seem to disappear
No vision, I only see to hear
Protection, I never needed none
Direction, just nowhere near the sun
You've go some stairs to heaven,
You may be right
I only know in my world,
I hate the light(I speed at night)
Alrigth
Dark touches send rushed through the brain
Black's whiter, burns brighter than the flame
No shadows, just whispers in the wind
No faces, just places to beginYou've got some stair to heaven, you may be right
I only know in my world,
I hate the light I speed at nightI speed at night?
I speed at night, night, night, night
I speed at night, night, night, night
No shadows, no faces, just whispers in dark places
(I speed at night) 
Tired of living in the black and white?
Where fools can tell you that you're never right
I know a place where the film's in color
Just step inside of yourself
Here's a place in the front row
So on with the showThe same old shadow on the run
That's no shadow, it's your shadow's sonI know a place where the pools got water
And you don't need to know how to swim
Here's the key to the back door
Do you want more
Do you need more?Same old rhythm to the same old rhyme
The same old clock - same old timeThere's a place where the grass is greener
And you can shake, rattle and roll
Here's the key to the front door
Do you want more
Will you need more?Tired of living in the black and white
Where no-one's wrong and you're never right
Same old steps to the same old dance
Just one more reason - one more chance
Oh 
In the misty morning, on the edge of time
We've lost the rising sun, a final sign
As the misty morning rolls away to die
Reaching for the stars, we blind the skyWe sailed across the air before we learned to fly
We thought that it could never end
We'd glide above the ground before we learned to run, run
Now it seems our world has come undoneOh they say that it's over
And it just had to be
Ooh they say that it's over
We're lost children of the sea, ohWe made the mountains shake with laughter as we played
Hiding in our corner of the world
Then we did the demon dance and rushed to nevermore
Threw away the key and locked the doorOh they say that it's over, yeah
And it just had to be
Yes they say that it's over
We're lost children of the seaIn the misty morning, on the edge of time
We've lost the rising sun, a final sign
As the misty morning rolls away to die
Reaching for the stars, we blind the skyOh they say that it's over, yeah
And it just had to be
Oh they say that it's over
Poor lost children of the sea, yeahLook out! The sky is falling down!
Look out! The world is spinning round and round and round!
Look out! The sun is going black, black
Look out! It's never never never coming back, look out! 
Though you've decided that our love is wrong
And think that we should part
It seems as though I have loved you so long
You'll always be in my heart.Is it a sin
Is it a crime
Loving you dear like I do
If it's a crime then I'm guilty
Guilty of loving you.Maybe I'm wrong dreaming of you
Dreaming the lonely night through
If it's a crime then I'm guilty
Guilty of dreaming of youWhat can I do
What can I say
After I've taken the blame?
You say we're through
You'll go your way
But I'll always feel just the same. 
He was ready to rock and roll
So ready to lose control
But when a hungry heart
Gets a taste of freedom you better look outHe was ready to push and shove
Ready to fight for love
But I've seen it before
And it can make you crazy
The eyes are what you seeWhy are they watching meShe was ready to black and white
The colors were just too bright
She loved to fly
But she hated fallingShe was caught in the in-between
Her dirty would not come clean
She ran for light
But she just got darknessJust when you think you're free
The eyes are what you seeWhy are they watching me
Why do they do the things they do
Why are they watching me
Watching youIf only the eyes could see
Then you'd know your destiny
The mind is an enemy
And you just need a friendAre you ready for rock and roll
Ready to take control
If you see the eyes
Will it make you crazy crazy
Crazy 
She never breaks into the conversation
He seems to be the reason why she lives
She tries to be the perfect kind of stranger
But we always seem to love the most
The ones who never give, yeahIt's between two hearts
A personal situation
Between two hearts
The kind of love with a reputationWe never have to ask her why she's crying
The smile she has been kicked into a frown
But still it makes her day to be his pleasure
Should we open up her eyes
Can we ever break the spell
No one can tellIt's between two hearts
A personal combination
Between too hearts
The kind of love with a bad reputationPut on your party faces and come along
Join in the big parade
Here comes the camera
Do you look as good as your sister
Smile at the animals
They should be the ones in the cages
Turn the pagesAnother way to spend a rainy Sunday
Waiting for a call that never comes
The mystery is how she makes her choices
But don't we always choose
The ones who hide the sun
EveryoneIt's between two hearts
Love and desperation
Between two hearts
The kind of love
The kind of loveBetween two hearts
A personal situation
Between two hearts
The kind of love with a reputation 
Now that my dreams have gone dead
I see them burning in the fire
Just like the words that I've said
Ashes turned to ashes once againLook for a sign in the air
A light that dances in the sky
Maybe you'll see it somewhere
Oh, shining like a diamond
Promising that hope will never dieI might know the answer
Well, it's back there in my brain
Someday soon I'll be rising again
Higher than the sunI have been father and son
I cry for children of the night
Just because tears have begun
Beware of quiet voices
Thunder comes from silence - I am light 
Close the city and tell the people that something's coming to call
Death and darkness are rushing forward to take a bite from the wall, ohYou've nothing to say
They're breaking away
If you listen to fools
The Mob Rules
The Mob RulesKill the spirit and you'll be blinded, the end is always the same
Play with fire, you burn your fingers and lose your hold of the flame, ohIt's over, it's done
The end is begun
If you listen to fools
The Mob RulesYou've nothing to say
Oh, they're breaking away
If you listen to foolsBreak the circle and stop the movement, the wheel is thrown to the ground
Just remember it might start rolling and take you right back aroundYou're all fools!
The Mob Rules!
