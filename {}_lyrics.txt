Verse one:
Someone told me to believe
That if I believe, anything could happen
I tried and tried and tried
Nothing ever happened
Some things are impossible
The world is little not enough places for everything
Sometimes in life you just dreamChorus:
I want to fly
I want everyone to be okay
I want everything like I always wanted
There are so many big dreams in my little world
I want to live
Finally be free
Love everywhere
Why there are so many big dreams in my little worldVerse two:
I believed in everything
I gave my heart on every little thing I did
Who will give me my wings to fly?
Who will give all their hearts for you?
Who will make me free?
Why can't I live my life without everyone judging me?ChorusBridge:
I've got my wings; I can fly
Somebody gave everyone all they needed
I am free
I believed
Made it happen
Everything happened...Bridge:
I've got my wings; I can fly
Somebody gave everyone all they needed
I am free
I believed
Made it happen
Everything happened...Woke up realizing it was just a dream
The moment was perfect, I got so happy
So many...
So many...
So many dreamsChorus (2):
I want to fly
I want everyone to be equal
I want everything like I always wanted
I want liberty
So many dreams (Oh woah yeah)
Big dreams, big dreams
So many big dreams
In my little world
In my (Just my)
Big dreams (My dreams)
In my little world (My little world)
Big dreams in my little world...

And any time we get up, always end up on the news
Ain't worried bout no press and ain't worried bout the next chick

Its the plane you wanna catch to Vegas,
Things you swear you'll do before you die,
Its the city a lone that waits for you,

Let the music move you,
Lose yourself tonight,
Come alive..
Let the moment take you.
Lose yourself tonight. (x2)(Verse 2)Its the time your totally screwed up,
Still your tryin' get it outta your brain.
Its the fights you had when you didn't make up.
Its the past that you're dying to change.
Its all of the the money that you're saving,
while the good life passes by.
Its all the dreams that didn't come true,
'Cause you're too damn scared to try.(chorus)Hit the lights,

Cause everything is fine
And you can pick up all the pieces
That you left behindCause I never think about you
I'm better off without you
I don't miss you at all
I don't miss you at all
You don't spin around in my head
It's like you never existed
And I hope you don't call

And I'm not trying to fight it
No, I'm not trying to fight it
So you can cross my name right
off the wall
I don't miss you at allI go out seven nights a week
It feels so good to finally be free
And I party like I never did before
Oh, what in the world was I waiting for?
Everything is perfect now
Without you in my life
You could pick up all the pieces
that you left behindCause I never think about you
I'm better off without you
I don't miss you at all
I don't miss you at all
You don't spin around in my head

I'll decide
The path of my life
I'll choose
What I wanna do
You can stand
In the way
But the wall you made
Will come crumblin'
So I will say today[Chorus:]
Don't tell me
I'm wrong or right
Don't try to
Stir up a fight
Don't get in my way
When I wanna choose

Ever try to reach for something
But it's someone else's dream?
Every step that you take forward
It takes you right back where you beenAnd then when you least expect it
And you've tried about everything
Somebody hears your opinions
Somebody cares what you seeYou woke me up
No longer tired
With you I feel inspired
You help me find my fireYou're the new classic

No rehearsals
It's your life
If you're doing this crazy dance
Cause your making these crazy plansIt's just this is not a test
You put in work to be the best
It's a classic take
On a brand new game
Before the needle drops
They're gonna know your nameWhen it gets old don't lose the light
You're cold, I'll warm you up
Your fire is hot enough, enough, enoughYou're the new classic
You're the new PYT

Let me see you do that 
If time came to an end today
And we left too many things to say
If we could turn it back
What would we want to change
And now's the time to take a chance
Come on, we gotta make a stand
What have we got to lose
The choice is in our handsAnd we can find a way
To do anything, if we try toLive like there's no tomorrow
'Cause all we have is here, right now
Love like it's all that we know
The only chance that we ever found
Believe in what we feel inside
Believe and it will never die
Don't ever let this life pass us by
Live like there's no tomorrowIf there never was a night, a day
And memories could fade away
Then there'd be
Nothing left, but the dreams we made
Take a leap in faith and hope you fly
Feel what it's like to be alive
Give it all that we've got
And lay it all on the lineAnd we can find a way
To do anything, if we try toLive like there's no tomorrow
'Cause all we have is here, right now
Love like it's all that we know
The only chance that we ever found
Believe in what we feel inside
Believe and it will never die
Don't ever let this life pass us by
Live like there's no tomorrowBe here by my side
We'll do this together
Just you and me
Nothing is impossible
Nothing is impossibleLive like there's no tomorrow
'Cause all we have is here, right now
Love like it's all that we know
The only chance that we ever found
Believe in what we feel inside
Believe and it will never die

Well, you know everything's gonna be a breeze
That the end will no doubt justify the means
You can fix any problem at the slightest ease
Yes, pleaseWell, you might find out it'll go to your head
When you write a report on a book you never read
With the snap of your fingers you can make your bed
That's what I saidEverything is not what it seems
When you can get all you wanted in your wildest dreams
You might run into trouble if you go to extremes
Because everything is not what it seemsEverything is not what it seems
When you can have what you want by the simplest of means
Be careful not to mess with the balance of things
Because everything is not what it seems

Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, want to play?
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny, rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekendSo it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space baby
And I'll write your nameCherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king baby I'm your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait the worst is yet to come, oh no
Screaming, crying, perfect storm
I can make all the tables turn
Rose gardens filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
"Oh my God, who is she?"
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause darling I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydreamSo it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane (Insane)
But I've got a blank space baby
And I'll write your nameBoys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't say I didn't warn yaSo it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far

Preacher man walked into the club and he said he said
"Hey girl, can't you walk a mile straight?"
Father I'm torn and I'm selling my soul to the
Rhythm, the beat and the bass cause I can't
Confess my rock and roll ways
Cause I'm so possessed with the music
The music he playsI can't stop my feet from dancin' to the sound of his drum
(Oh no) I fell in love with my rock god
I can't keep my hips from swayin' to his sweet melody
You see I fell in love with my rock, rock godPreacher man took my hand and looked in my eyes
He said "Hey girl, can't you live your life right?"
"Father things aren't always so black and white
Don't cast the first stone cause I'm not alone"
And its not like I'm hurting anyone (whoo)
But I can't confess my rock, my rock and roll waysI can't stop my feet from dancin' to the sound of his drum
(Oh no) I fell in love with a rock god
I can't keep my hips from swayin' to his sweet melody
You see I fell in love with my rock, rock godI can't stop my feet from dancin' to the sound of his drum
(Oh no) I fell in love with my rock god
I can't keep my hips from swayin' to his sweet melody
You see I fell in love with my rock, rock godNo I wouldn't change a thing even if I could
Cause I chose a path and I'm not looking back
And I'm sorry if I left the angels crying
Over meI can't stop my feet from dancin' to the sound of his drum
(Oh no) I fell in love with my rock god
I can't keep my hips from swayin' to his sweet melody
You see I fell in love with my rock, rock godPreacher man, preacher man,
Preacher man, preacher man, forgive me for I don't know what I do
Preacher man, preacher man, preacher man why don't you understand?
Preacher man, preacher man
Cause I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
(Have you never felt this way? Have you never ever ever, felt this way?)
Yeah, I'm gone
Gone (I'm so sorry sorry)
Gone (Oh no)
My rock, rock god! 
 
ou got me sippin' on something
I can't compare to nothing
I've ever known, I'm hoping
That after this fever I'll survive
I know I'm acting a bit crazy
Strung out, a little bit hazy
Hand over heart, I'm praying
That I'm gonna make it out aliveThe bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice 'cause I won't hear
You might be right but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wantsYou got me scattered in pieces
Shining like stars and screaming
Lighting me up like Venus
But then you disappear and make me wait
And every second's like torture
Heroin drip, no more so
Finding a way to let go
Baby, baby, no, I can't escapeThe bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice 'cause I won't hear
You might be right but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants [3x]This is a modern fairytale
No happy endings
No wind in our sails
But I can't imagine a life without
Breathless moments
Breaking me down, down, down, downThe bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice 'cause I won't hear
You might be right but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants [3x]The heart wants what it wants, baby
It wants what it wants, baby
It wants what it wants [2x] 
A word's just a word
'Til you mean what you say
And love isn't love
'Til you give it a wayWe've all gotta give
Yes, something to give
To make a changeSend it on, on and on
Just one hand can heal another
Be a part, reach a heart
Just one spark starts a fireWith one little action
The chain reaction will never stop
Make it strong
Shine a light, and send it onJust smile, and the world
(Just smile, and the world)
Will smile along with you
That small act of love
Is meant for one who will become twoIf we take the chances
To change circumstances
Imagine all we can doIf we send it on, on and on
Just one hand can heal another
Be a part, reach a heart
Just one spark starts a fireWith one little action
The chain reaction will never stop
Make it strong
Shine a light, and send it on
Send it on, ooh, send it onThere's power in all
Of all the choices we make
So I'm starting now
There's not a moment to wasteA word's just a word
'Til you mean what you say
And love isn't love
'Til you give it awaySend it on, on and on

Crazy, Funky, Junky hat
Overslept, hair unslightly
Trying to look like a Taylor night
We've been there
I've done that
We can see through you'r funky hat 
I candy-coat and cover everything
But I'm still hiding underneath
It's been a long time,
It's been a long time
A thousand faces looking up at me
Hands all pointing to the ceiling
Oh what a feelingI've got friends in highly low places
I'm standing on post, and im posted up
Cant afford to lose them
I've got friends and highly low places
I'll go inside when I wanna party
Grab a girl and dance (don't touch me)[Chorus]
Whoa oh Whoa oh Whoa oh,
Why do I put myself in these situations
Whoa oh Whoa oh Whoa oh,
I keep pushing myself even though
I can't take it at all, whoaGirl, who taught you how to move like that?
At this pace you're at you're moving way too fast
I, I saw you from across the room
It's me vs. every guy
It's your choice, you chooseI've got friends in highly low places
It's been a long time it's been a long time
And maybe baby you can rise above the rest to meet me[Chorus: x2]You're worth,
Losing my self esteem
Your clever words mean
Nothing more to me than
Than a line I heard in a movie
You're worth,
Losing my losing my losing my self esteem
You're not worth,
Putting myself in these situations[Chorus: x2] 
Sleigh bells ring, are you listening,
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight,
We're happy tonight.
Walking in a winter wonderland.Gone away is the bluebird,
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song,
As we go along,
Walking in a winter wonderland.In the meadow we can build a snowman,
Then pretend that he is Parson BrownHe'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man,
But you can do the job
When you're in townLater on, we'll conspire,
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid,
The plans that we've made,
Walking in a winter wonderland.In the meadow we can build a snowman,
Then pretend that he is Parson BrownHe'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man,
But you can do the job
When you're in town.Later on, we'll conspire,
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid,
The plans that we've made,
Walking in a winter wonderland.To face unafraid,
The plans that we've made,
Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking in a winter wonderland

Hay algo que usted no iba a cambiar?
Si me amas, ests seguro que es extrao espectculoCreo que puedo, pero creo que no se
Me gusta quien soy, pero supongo que don "t
No puedo ser tu mueca de papel.
Yo quiero ser perfecta, pero yo soy yo
[Chorus:]
Yo quiero ser perfecta, pero ya ves
Cada abolladura, cada pequeo error,
Cada pequea grieta Cada chip,
Yo quiero ser perfecta
Al igual que usted,
Tiene sentido para m,
Perfectamente
PerfectamentePero slo hay mucho que puede hacer una chica
Cuando miro en el espejo lo que veo,
Me gusta usar zapatos
Te gustan los tacones altos, y las fantasas
Supongo que se podra decir
Pero yo soy lo que es real
Tal vez estoy de Venus
Usted es de Marte
El zapato no se ajustan[Chorus:]
Mis imperfecciones son lo que son
Creo que uno de nosotros debe hacer frente, con ella
Cada pequea grieta, cada chip,
Yo quiero ser perfecta, pero ya ves
Cada abolladura, cada pequeo error, s
Yo quiero ser perfecta, pero yo soy yo
Al igual que t
Yo quiero ser perfecta,
Perfectamente
Cuando miro en el espejo,Lo que veo tiene sentido para m, s
Que puede hacer una chica
Oh, perfectamente[Chorus:]
Yo quiero ser perfecta, pero yo soy yo
Yo quiero ser perfecta, pero ya ves
Pero estoy cansado de jugar esta farsa poco
Yo quiero ser perfecta,
Trato de encajar en el molde que ha realizado
Cada pequeo error, s
Cada pequea grieta, cada chip, cada Dent,
Al igual que t
Pero slo hay mucho,
Que puede hacer una chica
Lo que veo tiene sentido para m, s
Perfectamente
Cuando miro en el espejo,
Pero slo hay mucho,

Preacher man walked into the club and he said he said
"Hey girl, can't you walk a mile straight?"
Father I'm torn and I'm selling my soul to the
Rhythm, the beat and the bass cause I can't
Confess my rock and roll ways
Cause I'm so possessed with the music
The music he playsI can't stop my feet from dancin' to the sound of his drum
(Oh no) I fell in love with my rock god
I can't keep my hips from swayin' to his sweet melody
You see I fell in love with my rock, rock godPreacher man took my hand and looked in my eyes
He said "Hey girl, can't you live your life right?"
"Father things aren't always so black and white
Don't cast the first stone cause I'm not alone"
And its not like I'm hurting anyone (whoo)
But I can't confess my rock, my rock and roll waysI can't stop my feet from dancin' to the sound of his drum
(Oh no) I fell in love with a rock god
I can't keep my hips from swayin' to his sweet melody
You see I fell in love with my rock, rock godI can't stop my feet from dancin' to the sound of his drum
(Oh no) I fell in love with my rock god
I can't keep my hips from swayin' to his sweet melody
You see I fell in love with my rock, rock godNo I wouldn't change a thing even if I could
Cause I chose a path and I'm not looking back
And I'm sorry if I left the angels crying
Over meI can't stop my feet from dancin' to the sound of his drum
(Oh no) I fell in love with my rock god
I can't keep my hips from swayin' to his sweet melody
You see I fell in love with my rock, rock godPreacher man, preacher man,
Preacher man, preacher man, forgive me for I don't know what I do
